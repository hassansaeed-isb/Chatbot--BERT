This in turn helps to \\ndetermine the way information is stored, retrieved and modified in a computer’s memory. \\n \\n \\n1.2  BASIC CONCEPT OF DATA STRUCTURE \\n \\nData structure is a branch of computer science. The study of data structure helps you to \\nunderstand how data is organized and how data flow is managed to increase efficiency of \\nany process or program. Data structure is the structural representation of logical \\nrelationship between data elements. This means that a data structure organizes data items \\nbased on the relationship between the data elements. \\nExample: \\nA house can be identified by the house name, location, number of floors and so on. \\nThese structured set of variables depend on each other to identify the exact house. \\nSimilarly, data structure is a structured set of variables that are linked to each other, \\nwhich forms the basic component of a system \\n \\n1.2.1 Basic Terminology \\nData structures are the building blocks of any program or the software. Choosing the \\nappropriate data structure for a program is the most difficult task for a programmer. \\nFollowing terminology is used as far as data structures are concerned \\nData: Data can be defined as an elementary value or the collection of values, for \\nexample, student\\'s name and its id are the data about the student. \\nGroup Items: Data items which have subordinate data items are called Group item, for \\nexample, name of a student can have first name and the last name. \\n\\n\\nPage 3:\\n \\n \\nRecord: Record can be defined as the collection of various data items, for example, if we \\ntalk about the student entity, then its name, address, course and marks can be grouped \\ntogether to form the record for the student. \\nFile: A File is a collection of various records of one type of entity, for example, if there \\nare 60 employees in the class, then there will be 20 records in the related file where each \\nrecord contains the data about each employee. \\nAttribute and Entity: An entity represents the class of certain objects. it contains \\nvarious attributes. Each attribute represents the particular property of that entity. \\nField: Field is a single elementary unit of information representing the attribute of an \\nentity. \\n \\n1.2.2 Need for Data Structure \\n\\uf0b7 It gives different level of organization data. \\n\\uf0b7 It tells how data can be stored and accessed in its elementary level. \\n\\uf0b7 Provide operation on group of data, such as adding an item, looking up highest \\npriority item. \\n\\uf0b7 Provide a means to manage huge amount of data efficiently. \\n\\uf0b7 Provide fast searching and sorting of data. \\n \\n \\n1.2.3 Goals of Data Structure \\nData structure basically implements two complementary goals. \\n \\nCorrectness: Data structure is designed such that it operates correctly for all kinds of \\ninput, which is based on the domain of interest. In other words, correctness forms the \\nprimary goal of data structure, which always depends on the specific problems that the \\ndata structure is intended to solve. \\n \\nEfficiency: Data structure also needs to be efficient. It should process the data at high \\nspeed without utilizing much of the computer resources such as memory space. In a real \\ntime state, the efficiency of a data structure is an important factor that determines the \\nsuccess and failure of the process. \\n \\n1.2.4 Features of Data Structure \\nSome of the important features of data structures are: \\n \\nRobustness: Generally, all computer programmers wish to produce software that \\ngenerates correct output for every possible input provided to it, as well as execute \\n\\n\\nPage 4:\\n \\n \\nefficiently on all hardware platforms. This kind of robust software must be able to \\nmanage both valid and invalid inputs. \\n \\n \\nAdaptability: Developing software projects such as word processors, Web browsers and \\nInternet search engine involves large software systems that work or execute correctly and \\nefficiently for many years. Moreover, software evolves due to ever changing market \\nconditions or due to emerging technologies. \\n \\nReusability: Reusability and adaptability go hand-in-hand. \\nIt is a known fact that the programmer requires many resources for developing any \\nsoftware, which makes it an expensive enterprise. However, if the software is developed \\nin a reusable and adaptable way, then it can be implemented in most of the future \\napplications. Thus, by implementing quality data structures, it is possible to develop \\nreusable software, which tends to be cost effective and time saving. \\n \\n1.3 CLASSIFICATION OF DATA STRUCTURES \\n \\nA data structure provides a structured set of variables that are associated with each other \\nin different ways. It forms a basis of programming tool that represents the relationship \\nbetween data elements and helps programmers to process the data easily. \\n \\nData structure can be classified into two categories: \\n1.3.1 \\nPrimitive data structure \\n1.3.2 \\nNon-primitive data structure \\n \\nFigure 1.1shows the different classifications of data structures. \\n\\n\\nPage 5:\\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.1 Classifications of data structures. \\n \\n1.3.1  Primitive Data Structure \\n \\nPrimitive data structures consist of the numbers and the characters which are \\nbuilt in programs. These can be manipulated or operated directly by the \\nmachine level instructions. Basic data types such as integer, real, character, \\nand Boolean come under primitive data structures. These data types are also \\nknown as simple data types because they consist of characters that cannot be \\ndivided. \\n \\n1.3.2  Non-primitive Data Structure \\nNon-primitive data structures are those that are derived from primitive data structures. \\nThese data structures cannot be operated or manipulated directly by the machine level \\ninstructions. They focus on formation of a set of data elements that is either \\nhomogeneous (same data type) or heterogeneous (different data type).  \\nThese are further divided into linear and non-linear data structure based on the structure \\nand arrangement of data. \\n \\n1.3.2.1 Linear Data Structure \\nA data structure that maintains a linear relationship among its elements is called a linear \\ndata structure. Here, the data is arranged in a linear fashion. But in the memory, the \\narrangement may not be sequential. \\n\\n\\nPage 6:\\n \\n \\nEx:  Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues. \\n \\n1.3.2.1 Non-linear Data Structure \\nNon-linear data structure is a kind of data structure in which data elements are not \\narranged in a sequential order. There is a hierarchical relationship between individual \\ndata items. Here, the insertion and deletion of data is not possible in a linear fashion. \\nTrees and graphs are examples of non-linear data structures. \\n \\nI) Array \\n \\nArray, in general, refers to an orderly arrangement of data elements. Array is a type of \\ndata structure that stores data elements in adjacent locations. Array is considered as linear \\ndata structure that stores elements of same data types. Hence, it is also called as a linear \\nhomogenous data structure. \\n \\nWhen we declare an array, we can assign initial values to each of its elements by \\nenclosing the values in braces { }. \\n \\nint Num [5] = { 26, 7, 67, 50, 66 }; \\n \\nThis declaration will create an array as shown below: \\n0 \\n1 \\n2 \\n3 \\n4 \\nNum 26 \\n7 \\n67 \\n50 \\n66 \\nFigure 1.2 Array \\nThe number of values inside braces { } should be equal to the number of elements that \\nwe declare for the array inside the square brackets [ ]. In the example of array Paul, we \\nhave declared 5 elements and in the list of initial values within braces { } we have \\nspecified 5 values, one for each element. After this declaration, array Paul will have five \\nintegers, as we have provided 5 initialization values. \\n \\nArrays can be classified as one-dimensional array, two-dimensional array or \\nmultidimensional array. \\nOne-dimensional Array: It has only one row of elements. It is stored in ascending \\nstorage location. \\nTwo-dimensional Array: It consists of multiple rows and columns of data elements. It is \\nalso called as a matrix. \\nMultidimensional Array: Multidimensional arrays can be defined as array of \\narrays. Multidimensional arrays are not bounded to two indices or two \\ndimensions. They can include as many indices as required. \\n \\nLimitations: \\n\\uf0b7 Arrays are of fixed size. \\n\\n\\nPage 7:\\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Data elements are stored in contiguous memory locations which may not be   \\nalways available. \\n\\uf0b7 Insertion and deletion of elements can be problematic because of shifting of \\nelements from their positions. \\nHowever, these limitations can be solved by using linked lists. \\n \\n Applications: \\n\\uf0b7 Storing list of data elements belonging to same data type \\n\\uf0b7 Auxiliary storage for other data structures \\n\\uf0b7 Storage of binary tree elements of fixed count \\n\\uf0b7 Storage of matrices \\n \\nII) Linked List \\n \\nA linked list is a data structure in which each data element contains a pointer \\nor link to the next element in the list. Through linked list, insertion and \\ndeletion of the data element is possible at all places of a linear list. Also in \\nlinked list, it is not necessary to have the data elements stored in consecutive \\nlocations. It allocates space for each data item in its own block of memory. \\nThus, a linked list is considered as a chain of data elements or records called \\nnodes. Each node in the list contains information field and a pointer field. The \\ninformation field contains the actual data and the pointer field contains address \\nof the subsequent nodes in the list. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.3: A Linked List \\n \\nFigure 1.3 represents a linked list with 4 nodes. Each node has two parts. The left part in \\nthe node represents the information part which contains an entire record of data items and \\nthe right part represents the pointer to the next node. The pointer of the last node contains \\na null pointer. \\n \\nAdvantage: Easier to insert or delete data elements \\n\\n\\nPage 8:\\n \\n \\nDisadvantage: Slow search operation and requires more memory space \\n \\nApplications: \\n\\uf0b7 Implementing stacks, queues, binary trees and graphs of predefined size. \\n\\uf0b7 Implement dynamic memory management functions of operating system. \\n\\uf0b7 Polynomial implementation for mathematical operations \\n\\uf0b7 Circular linked list is used to implement OS or application functions that require \\nround robin execution of tasks. \\n\\uf0b7 Circular linked list is used in a slide show where a user wants to go back to the \\nfirst slide after last slide is displayed. \\n\\uf0b7 Doubly linked list is used in the implementation of forward and backward buttons \\nin a browser to move backwards and forward in the opened pages of a website. \\n\\uf0b7 Circular queue is used to maintain the playing sequence of multiple players in a \\ngame. \\n \\nIII) Stacks \\n \\nA stack is a linear data structure in which insertion and deletion of elements are done at \\nonly one end, which is known as the top of the stack. Stack is called a last-in, first-out \\n(LIFO) structure because the last element which is added to the stack is the first \\nelement which is deleted from the stack. \\n \\nFigure 1.4: A Stack \\n \\n \\nIn the computer’s memory, stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked \\nlists. Figure 1.4 is a schematic diagram of a stack. Here, element FF is the top \\nof the stack and element AA is the bottom of the stack. Elements are added to \\nthe stack from the top. Since it follows LIFO pattern, EE cannot be deleted \\nbefore FF is deleted, and similarly DD cannot be deleted before EE is deleted \\nand so on. \\n \\nApplications: \\n\\uf0b7 Temporary storage structure for recursive operations \\n\\n\\nPage 9:\\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Auxiliary storage structure for nested operations, function calls, \\ndeferred/postponed functions \\n\\uf0b7 Manage function calls \\n\\uf0b7 Evaluation of arithmetic expressions in various programming languages \\n\\uf0b7 Conversion of infix expressions into postfix expressions \\n\\uf0b7 Checking syntax of expressions in a programming environment \\n\\uf0b7 Matching of parenthesis \\n\\uf0b7 String reversal \\n\\uf0b7 In all the problems solutions based on backtracking. \\n\\uf0b7 Used in depth first search in graph and tree traversal. \\n\\uf0b7 Operating System functions \\n\\uf0b7 UNDO and REDO functions in an editor. \\n \\nIV) Queues \\n \\nA queue is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure in which the element that is \\ninserted first is the first one to be taken out. The elements in a queue are added at one \\nend called the rear and removed from the other end called the front. Like stacks, \\nqueues can be implemented by using either arrays or linked lists. \\n \\nFigure 1.5 shows a queue with 4 elements, where 55 is the front element and 65 is the \\nrear element.

The root of the tree is the node \\n60 at the top. Node 29 and 44 are the successors of the node 60.

Simply, Data Structure are used to reduce complexity (mostly the time \\ncomplexity) of the code. \\n\\n\\nPage 12:\\n \\n \\nData structures can be two types:  \\n1. Static Data Structure \\n2. Dynamic Data Structure \\nWhat is a Static Data structure? \\nIn Static data structure the size of the structure is fixed. The content of the data \\nstructure can be modified but without changing the memory space allocated to it. \\n \\nExample of Static Data Structures: Array \\n \\nWhat is Dynamic Data Structure? \\nIn Dynamic data structure the size of the structure in not fixed and can be modified \\nduring the operations performed on it. Dynamic data structures are designed to facilitate \\nchange of data structures in the run time. \\n \\nExample of Dynamic Data Structures: Linked List \\n \\nStatic Data Structure vs Dynamic Data Structure \\nStatic Data structure has fixed memory size whereas in Dynamic Data Structure, the \\nsize can be randomly updated during run time which may be considered efficient with \\nrespect to memory complexity of the code. Static Data Structure provides more easier \\naccess to elements with respect to dynamic data structure. Unlike static data structures, \\ndynamic data structures are flexible. \\n \\n \\n1.5 OPERATIONS ON DATA STRUCTURES \\n \\nThis section discusses the different operations that can be performed on the various data \\nstructures previously mentioned. \\n \\nTraversing  It means to access each data item exactly once so that it can be processed. \\nFor example, to print the names of all the students in a class. \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 13:\\n \\n \\nSearching  It is used to find the location of one or more data items that satisfy the given \\nconstraint. Such a data item may or may not be present in the given collection of data \\nitems. For example, to find the names of all the students who secured 100 marks in \\nmathematics. \\n \\nInserting  It is used to add new data items to the given list of data items. For example, to \\nadd the details of a new student who has recently joined the course. \\n \\nDeleting  It means to remove (delete) a particular data item from the given collection of \\ndata items. For example, to delete the name of a student who has left the course. \\n \\nSorting   Data items can be arranged in some order like ascending order or descending \\norder depending on the type of application. For example, arranging the names of students \\nin a class in an alphabetical order, or calculating the top three winners by arranging the \\nparticipants’ scores in descending order and then extracting the top three. \\n \\nMerging   Lists of two sorted data items can be combined to form a single list of sorted \\ndata items. \\n \\n \\n1.6 ABSTRACT DATA TYPE \\n \\nAccording to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a data \\nstructure is an organization of information, usually in the memory, for better \\nalgorithm efficiency. Data structures include queues, stacks, linked lists, \\ndictionary, and trees. They could also be a conceptual entity, such as the name \\nand address of a person. \\n \\nFrom the above definition, it is clear that the operations in data structure \\ninvolve higher -level abstractions such as, adding or deleting an item from a \\nlist, accessing the highest priority item in a list, or searching and sorting an \\nitem in a list. When the data structure does such operations, it is called an \\nabstract data type. \\n \\nIt can be defined as a collection of data items together with the operations on the data. \\nThe word “abstract” refers to the fact that the data and the basic operations defined on it \\nare being studied independently of how they are implemented. It involves what can be \\ndone with the data, not how has to be done. For ex, in the below figure the user would be \\ninvolved in checking that what can be done with the data collected not how it has to be \\ndone. \\n \\nAn implementation of ADT consists of storage structures to store the data items and \\nalgorithms for basic operation. All the data structures i.e. array, linked list, stack, queue \\netc are examples of ADT. \\n\\n\\nPage 14:\\n \\n \\n \\nAdvantage of using ADTs \\nIn the real world, programs evolve as a result of new requirements or constraints, so a \\nmodification to a program commonly requires a change in one or more of its data \\nstructures. For example, if you want to add a new field to a student’s record to keep track \\nof more information about each student, then it will be better to replace an array with a \\nlinked structure to improve the program’s efficiency. In such a scenario, rewriting every \\nprocedure that uses the changed structure is not desirable. Therefore, a better alternative \\nis to separate the use of a data structure from the details of its implementation. This is the \\nprinciple underlying the use of abstract data types. \\n \\n \\n1.7 ALGORITHM \\nAlgorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed \\nin a certain order to get the desired output. Algorithms are generally created independent \\nof underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one \\nprogramming language. \\nFrom the data structure point of view, following are some important categories of \\nalgorithms − \\n\\uf0b7 Search − Algorithm to search an item in a data structure. \\n\\uf0b7 Sort − Algorithm to sort items in a certain order. \\n\\uf0b7 Insert − Algorithm to insert item in a data structure. \\n\\uf0b7 Update − Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure. \\n\\uf0b7 Delete − Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure. \\n \\n1.7.1 Characteristics of an Algorithm \\nNot all procedures can be called an algorithm. An algorithm should have the following \\ncharacteristics − \\nAn algorithm should have the following characteristics − \\n\\uf0b7 \\nClear and Unambiguous: Algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. Each of \\nits steps should be clear in all aspects and must lead to only one meaning. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nWell-Defined Inputs: If an algorithm says to take inputs, it should be well-\\ndefined inputs. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nWell-Defined Outputs: The algorithm must clearly define what output will be \\nyielded and it should be well-defined as well. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nFinite-ness: The algorithm must be finite, i.e. it should not end up in an infinite \\nloops or similar. \\n\\n\\nPage 15:\\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 \\nFeasible: The algorithm must be simple, generic and practical, such that it can \\nbe executed upon will the available resources. It must not contain some future \\ntechnology, or anything. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nLanguage Independent: The Algorithm designed must be language-\\nindependent, i.e. it must be just plain instructions that can be implemented in any \\nlanguage, and yet the output will be same, as expected. \\n \\n1.7.2 Advantages and Disadvantages of Algorithm \\nAdvantages of Algorithms: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIt is easy to understand. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAlgorithm is a step-wise representation of a solution to a given problem. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIn Algorithm the problem is broken down into smaller pieces or steps hence, it \\nis easier for the programmer to convert it into an actual program. \\nDisadvantages of Algorithms: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nWriting an algorithm takes a long time so it is time-consuming. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nBranching and Looping statements are difficult to show in Algorithms. \\n \\n1.7.3 Different approach to design an algorithm \\n \\n1. Top-Down Approach: A top-down approach starts with identifying major \\ncomponents of system or program decomposing them into their lower level components \\n& iterating until desired level of module complexity is achieved . In this we start with \\ntopmost module & incrementally add modules that is calls.  \\n \\n2. Bottom-Up Approach: A bottom-up approach starts with designing most basic or \\nprimitive component & proceeds to higher level components. Starting from very bottom , \\noperations that provide layer of abstraction are implemented \\n \\n1.7.4 How to Write an Algorithm? \\nThere are no well-defined standards for writing algorithms. Rather, it is problem and \\nresource dependent. Algorithms are never written to support a particular programming \\ncode. \\nAs we know that all programming languages share basic code constructs like loops (do, \\nfor, while), flow-control (if-else), etc. These common constructs can be used to write an \\nalgorithm. \\n\\n\\nPage 16:\\n \\n \\nWe write algorithms in a step-by-step manner, but it is not always the case. Algorithm \\nwriting is a process and is executed after the problem domain is well-defined. That is, \\nwe should know the problem domain, for which we are designing a solution. \\nExample \\nLet\\'s try to learn algorithm-writing by using an example. \\nProblem − Design an algorithm to add two numbers and display the result. \\nStep 1 − START \\nStep 2 − declare three integers a, b & c \\nStep 3 − define values of a & b \\nStep 4 − add values of a & b \\nStep 5 − store output of step 4 to c \\nStep 6 − print c \\nStep 7 − STOP \\nAlgorithms tell the programmers how to code the program. Alternatively, the algorithm \\ncan be written as − \\nStep 1 − START ADD \\nStep 2 − get values of a & b \\nStep 3 − c ← a + b \\nStep 4 − display c \\nStep 5 − STOP \\nIn design and analysis of algorithms, usually the second method is used to describe an \\nalgorithm. It makes it easy for the analyst to analyze the algorithm ignoring all unwanted \\ndefinitions. He can observe what operations are being used and how the process is \\nflowing. \\nWriting step numbers, is optional. \\nWe design an algorithm to get a solution of a given problem. A problem can be solved \\nin more than one ways. \\n \\nHence, many solution algorithms can be derived for a given problem. The next step is to \\nanalyze those proposed solution algorithms and implement the best suitable solution. \\n\\n\\nPage 17:\\n \\n \\n \\n1.8 ALGORITHM COMPLEXITY \\nSuppose X is an algorithm and n is the size of input data, the time and space used by the \\nalgorithm X are the two main factors, which decide the efficiency of X. \\n\\uf0b7 Time Factor − Time is measured by counting the number of key operations such \\nas comparisons in the sorting algorithm. \\n\\uf0b7 Space Factor − Space is measured by counting the maximum memory space \\nrequired by the algorithm. \\nThe complexity of an algorithm f(n) gives the running time and/or the storage space \\nrequired by the algorithm in terms of n as the size of input data. \\n1.8.1 Space Complexity \\nSpace complexity of an algorithm represents the amount of memory space required by \\nthe algorithm in its life cycle. The space required by an algorithm is equal to the sum of \\nthe following two components − \\n\\uf0b7 A fixed part that is a space required to store certain data and variables, that are \\nindependent of the size of the problem. For example, simple variables and \\nconstants used, program size, etc. \\n\\uf0b7 A variable part is a space required by variables, whose size depends on the size of \\nthe problem. For example, dynamic memory allocation, recursion stack space, \\netc. \\nSpace complexity S(P) of any algorithm P is S(P) = C + SP(I), where C is the fixed part \\nand S(I) is the variable part of the algorithm, which depends on instance characteristic I. \\nFollowing is a simple example that tries to explain the concept − \\nAlgorithm: SUM(A, B) \\nStep 1 -  START \\nStep 2 -  C ← A + B + 10 \\nStep 3 -  Stop \\nHere we have three variables A, B, and C and one constant. Hence S(P) = 1 + 3. Now, \\nspace depends on data types of given variables and constant types and it will be \\nmultiplied accordingly. \\n \\n1.8.2 Time Complexity \\nTime complexity of an algorithm represents the amount of time required by the \\nalgorithm to run to completion. Time requirements can be defined as a numerical \\nfunction T(n), where T(n) can be measured as the number of steps, provided each step \\nconsumes constant time. \\n\\n\\nPage 18:\\n \\n \\nFor example, addition of two n-bit integers takes n steps. Consequently, the total \\ncomputational time is T(n) = c ∗ n, where c is the time taken for the addition of two bits. \\nHere, we observe that T(n) grows linearly as the input size increases. \\n \\n1.9 ALGORITHM ANALYSIS \\nEfficiency of an algorithm can be analyzed at two different stages, before \\nimplementation and after implementation. They are the following – \\n\\uf0b7 A Priori Analysis or Performance or Asymptotic Analysis − This is a theoretical \\nanalysis of an algorithm. Efficiency of an algorithm is measured by assuming \\nthat all other factors, for example, processor speed, are constant and have no \\neffect on the implementation. \\n\\uf0b7 A Posterior Analysis or Performance Measurement − This is an empirical \\nanalysis of an algorithm. The selected algorithm is implemented using \\nprogramming language. This is then executed on target computer machine. In \\nthis analysis, actual statistics like running time and space required, are collected. \\nWe shall learn about a priori algorithm analysis. Algorithm analysis deals with the \\nexecution or running time of various operations involved. The running time of an \\noperation can be defined as the number of computer instructions executed per operation. \\nAnalysis of an algorithm is required to determine the amount of resources such as time \\nand storage necessary to execute the algorithm. Usually, the efficiency or running time of \\nan algorithm is stated as a function which relates the input length to the time complexity \\nor space complexity. \\n \\nAlgorithm analysis framework involves finding out the time taken and the memory space \\nrequired by a program to execute the program. It also determines how the input size of a \\nprogram influences the running time of the program. \\n \\nIn theoretical analysis of algorithms, it is common to estimate their complexity in the \\nasymptotic sense, i.e., to estimate the complexity function for arbitrarily large input. Big-\\nO notation, Omega notation, and Theta notation are used to estimate the complexity \\nfunction for large arbitrary input. \\n \\n1.9.1 Types of Analysis \\n \\nThe efficiency of some algorithms may vary for inputs of the same size. For \\nsuch algorithms, we need to differentiate between the worst case, average case \\nand best case efficiencies. \\n \\n1.9.1.1 Best Case Analysis \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 19:\\n \\n \\nIf an algorithm takes the least amount of time to execute a specific set of \\ninput, then it is called the best case time complexity. The best case efficiency \\nof an algorithm is the efficiency for the best case input of size n. Because of \\nthis input, the algorithm runs the fastest among all the possible inputs of the \\nsame size. \\n \\n1.9.1.2 Average Case Analysis \\n \\nIf the time complexity of an algorithm for certain sets of inputs are on an \\naverage, then such a time complexity is called average case time complexity. \\n \\nAverage case analysis provides necessary information about an algorithm’s \\nbehavior on a typical or random input. You must make some assumption about \\nthe possible inputs of size n to analyze the average case efficiency of \\nalgorithm. \\n \\n1.9.1.3 Worst Case Analysis \\n \\nIf an algorithm takes maximum amount of time to execute for a specific set of input, then \\nit is called the worst case time complexity. The worst case efficiency of an algorithm is \\nthe efficiency for the worst case input of size n. The algorithm runs the longest among all \\nthe possible inputs of the similar size because of this input of size n. \\n \\n \\n1.10 MATHEMATICAL NOTATION  \\n \\nAlgorithms are widely used in various areas of study. We can solve different problems \\nusing the same algorithm. Therefore, all algorithms must follow a standard. The \\nmathematical notations use symbols or symbolic expressions, which have a precise \\nsemantic meaning. \\n \\n \\n1.10.1  Asymptotic Notations \\n \\nA problem may have various algorithmic solutions. In order to choose the best algorithm \\nfor a particular process, you must be able to judge the time taken to run a particular \\nsolution. More accurately, you must be able to judge the time taken to run two solutions, \\nand choose the better among the two. \\nTo select the best algorithm, it is necessary to check the efficiency of each algorithm. The \\nefficiency of each algorithm can be checked by computing its time complexity. The \\nasymptotic notations help to represent the time complexity in a shorthand way. It can \\ngenerally be represented as the fastest possible, slowest possible or average possible. \\n\\n\\nPage 20:\\n \\n \\nThe notations such as O (Big-O), Ώ (Omega), and θ (Theta) are called as asymptotic \\nnotations. These are the mathematical notations that are used in three different cases of \\ntime complexity. \\n \\n \\n1.10.1.1 Big-O Notation \\n \\n‘O’ is the representation for Big-O notation. Big -O is the method used to express the \\nupper bound of the running time of an algorithm. It is used to describe the performance or \\ntime complexity of the algorithm. Big-O specifically describes the worst-case scenario \\nand can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used by the \\nalgorithm. \\n \\nTable 2.1 gives some names and examples of the common orders used to \\ndescribe functions. These orders are ranked from top to bottom. \\n \\n \\nTable 2.1: Common Orders \\nTime complexity \\nExamples \\n1 O(1) \\nConstant \\n \\nAdding to the front of a linked list \\n \\n2 O(log n) \\nLogarithmic \\n \\nFinding an entry in a sorted array \\n \\n3 O(n) \\nLinear \\n \\nFinding an entry in an unsorted array \\n \\n4 O(n log n) \\nLinearithmic \\n \\nSorting ‘n’ items by ‘divide-and-conquer’ \\n \\n5 O(n2) \\nQuadratic \\n \\nShortest path between two nodes in a graph  \\n6 O(n3) \\nCubic \\n \\nSimultaneous linear equations \\n \\n7 O(2n) \\nExponential \\n \\nThe Towers of Hanoi problem \\n \\n \\nBig-O notation is generally used to express an ordering property among the \\nfunctions. This notation helps in calculating the maximum amount of time \\ntaken by an algorithm to compute a problem. Big-O is defined as: \\n \\nf(n) ≤ c ∗ g(n) \\n \\nwhere, n can be any number of inputs or outputs and f(n) as well as g(n) are \\ntwo non-negative functions. These functions are true only if there is a constant \\nc and a non-negative integer n0 such that, \\nn ≥ n0. \\n \\nThe Big-O can also be denoted as f(n) = O(g(n)), where f(n) and g(n) are two \\nnon -negative functions and f(n) < g(n) if g(n) is multiple of some constant c. \\nThe graphical representation of f(n) = O(g(n)) is shown in figure 2.1, where \\nthe running time increases considerably when n increases. \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 21:\\n \\n \\n \\nExample: Consider f(n)=15n3+40n2+2nlog n+2n. As the value of n \\nincreases, n3 becomes much larger than n2, nlog n, and n. Hence, it \\ndominates the function f(n) and we can consider the running time to grow by \\nthe order of n3. Therefore, it can be written as f(n)=O(n3). \\n \\nThe values of n for f(n) and C* g(n) will not be less than n0. Therefore, the \\nvalues less than n0 are not considered relevant. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.8: Big-O Notation f(n) = O(g(n)) \\n \\nLet us take an example to understand the Big-O notation more clearly. \\n \\nExample: \\n \\n           \\nConsider function f(n) = 2(n)+2 and g(n) = n2. \\n \\nWe need to find the constant c such that f(n) ≤ c ∗ g(n). \\nLet n = 1, then \\nf(n) = 2(n)+2 = 2(1)+2 = 4 \\n \\ng(n) = n2 = 12 = 1 \\nHere, f(n)>g(n) \\nLet n = 2, then \\nf(n) = 2(n)+2 = 2(2)+2 = 6 \\ng(n) = n2 = 22 = 4 \\n \\nHere, f(n)>g(n) \\nLet n = 3, then \\nf(n) = 2(n)+2 = 2(3)+2 = 8 \\ng(n) = n2 = 32 = 9 \\nHere, f(n)<g(n) \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 22:\\n \\n \\nThus, when n is greater than 2, we get f(n)<g(n). In other words, as n becomes larger, \\nthe running time increases considerably. This concludes that the Big-O helps to \\ndetermine the ‘upper bound’ of the algorithm’s run-time. \\n \\n \\nLimitations of Big O Notation  \\nThere are certain limitations with the Big O notation of expressing the complexity of \\nalgorithms. These limitations are as follows:  \\n\\uf0b7 Many algorithms are simply too hard to analyse mathematically.  \\n\\uf0b7 There may not be sufficient information to calculate the behaviour of the \\nalgorithm in the average case.  \\n\\uf0b7 Big O analysis only tells us how the algorithm grows with the size of the problem, \\nnot how efficient it is, as it does not consider the programming effort.  \\n\\uf0b7 It ignores important constants. For example, if one algorithm takes O(n2 ) time to \\nexecute and the other takes O(100000n2 ) time to execute, then as per Big O, both \\nalgorithm have equal time complexity. In real-time systems, this may be a serious \\nconsideration. \\n \\n1.10.1.2 Omega Notation \\n \\n‘Ω’ is the representation for Omega notation. Omega describes the manner in which an \\nalgorithm performs in the best case time complexity. This notation provides the minimum \\namount of time taken by an algorithm to compute a problem. Thus, it is considered that \\nomega gives the \"lower bound\" of the algorithm\\'s run-time. Omega is defined as: \\n \\nf(n) ≥ c ∗ g(n) \\n \\nWhere, n is any number of inputs or outputs and f(n) and g(n) are two non-negative \\nfunctions. These functions are true only if there is a constant c and a non-negative integer \\nn0 such that n>n0. \\n \\nOmega can also be denoted as f(n) = Ώ (g(n)) where, f of n is equal to Omega of g of n . \\nThe graphical representation of f(n) = Ώ (g(n)) is shown in figure 2.2. The function f(n) is \\nsaid to be in Ώ (g(n)), if f(n) is bounded below by some constant multiple of g(n) for all \\nlarge values of n, i.e., if there exists some positive constant c and some non-negative \\ninteger n0, such that f(n) ≥ c ∗ g(n) for all n ≥n0. \\nFigure 2.2 shows Omega notation. \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.9  Omega Notation f(n) = Ώ (g(n)) \\n\\n\\nPage 23:\\n \\n \\n \\nLet us take an example to understand the Omega notation more clearly. \\n \\nExample: \\n       \\nConsider function f(n) = 2n2+5 and g(n) = 7n. \\nWe need to find the constant c such that f(n) ≥ c ∗ g(n). \\n \\nLet n = 0, then \\nf(n) = 2n2+5 = 2(0)2+5 = 5 \\ng(n) = 7(n) = 7(0) = 0 \\nHere, f(n)>g(n) \\nLet n = 1, then \\n \\nf(n) = 2n2+5 = 2(1)2+5 = 7 \\ng(n) = 7(n) = 7(1) = 7 \\nHere, f(n)=g(n) \\nLet n = 2, then \\nf(n) = 2n2+5 = 2(2)2+5 = 13 \\n \\ng(n) = 7(n) = 7(2) = 14 \\nHere, f(n)<g(n) \\n \\nThus, for n=1, we get f(n) ≥ c ∗ g(n). This concludes that Omega helps to \\ndetermine the \"lower bound\" of the algorithm\\'s run-time. \\n \\n \\n1.10.1.3 Theta Notation \\n \\n\\'θ\\' is the representation for Theta notation. Theta notation is used when the \\nupper bound and lower bound of an algorithm are in the same order of \\nmagnitude. Theta can be defined as: \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 24:\\n \\n \\nc1 ∗ g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c2 ∗ g(n) \\nfor all n>n0 \\n \\nWhere, n is any number of inputs or outputs and f(n) and g(n) are two non-\\nnegative functions. These functions are true only if there are two constants \\nnamely, c1, c2, and a non-negative integer n0. \\n \\nTheta can also be denoted as f(n) = θ(g(n)) where, f of n is equal to Theta of g \\nof n. The graphical representation of f(n) = θ(g(n)) is shown in figure 2.3. The \\nfunction f(n) is said to be in θ (g(n)) if f(n) is bounded both above and below \\nby some positive constant multiples of g(n) for all large values of n, i.e., if \\nthere exists some positive constant c1 and c2 and some non-negative integer \\nn0, such that C2g(n)≤f(n)≤ C1g(n) for all n≥n0. \\nFigure shows Theta notation. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.10: Theta Notation f(n) = θ(g(n)) \\n \\nLet us take an example to understand the Theta notation more clearly. \\n \\nExample: Consider function f(n) = 4n + 3 and g(n) = 4n for all n ≥ 3; and f(n) = 4n + 3 \\nand g(n) = 5n for all n ≥ 3. \\n \\nThen the result of the function will be: \\nLet n = 3 \\nf(n) = 4n + 3 = 4(3)+3 = 15 \\ng(n) = 4n =4(3) = 12 and \\n \\nf(n) = 4n + 3 = 4(3)+3 = 15 \\ng(n) = 5n =5(3) = 15 and \\n\\n\\nPage 25:\\n \\n \\nhere, c1 is 4, c2 is 5 and n0 is 3 \\nThus, from the above equation we get c1 g(n) f(n) c2 g(n).

Maximum and Minimum Problem \\n2. Binary Search \\n\\n\\nPage 26:\\n \\n \\n3. Sorting (merge sort, quick sort) \\n4. Tower of Hanoi. \\nFundamental of Divide & Conquer Strategy: \\nThere are two fundamentals of Divide & Conquer Strategy: \\n1. Relational Formula \\n2. Stopping Condition \\n1. Relational Formula: It is the formula that we generate from the given technique. \\nAfter generation of Formula, we apply D&C Strategy, i.e., we break the problem \\nrecursively & solve the broken subproblems. \\n2. Stopping Condition: When we break the problem using Divide & Conquer Strategy, \\nthen we need to know that for how much time, we need to apply divide & Conquer. So, \\nthe condition where the need to stop our recursion steps of D&C is called as Stopping \\nCondition. \\nApplications of Divide and Conquer Approach: \\nFollowing algorithms are based on the concept of the Divide and Conquer Technique: \\n1. Binary Search: The binary search algorithm is a searching algorithm, which is \\nalso called a half-interval search or logarithmic search. It works by comparing the \\ntarget value with the middle element existing in a sorted array. After making the \\ncomparison, if the value differs, then the half that cannot contain the target will \\neventually eliminate, followed by continuing the search on the other half. We will \\nagain consider the middle element and compare it with the target value. The \\nprocess keeps on repeating until the target value is met. If we found the other half \\nto be empty after ending the search, then it can be concluded that the target is not \\npresent in the array. \\n2. Quicksort: It is the most efficient sorting algorithm, which is also known as \\npartition-exchange sort. It starts by selecting a pivot value from an array followed \\nby dividing the rest of the array elements into two sub-arrays. The partition is \\nmade by comparing each of the elements with the pivot value. It compares \\nwhether the element holds a greater value or lesser value than the pivot and then \\nsort the arrays recursively. \\n3. Merge Sort: It is a sorting algorithm that sorts an array by making comparisons. \\nIt starts by dividing an array into sub-array and then recursively sorts each of \\nthem. After the sorting is done, it merges them back. \\nAdvantages of Divide and Conquer \\n\\n\\nPage 27:\\n \\n \\no Divide and Conquer tend to successfully solve one of the biggest problems, such \\nas the Tower of Hanoi, a mathematical puzzle. It is challenging to solve \\ncomplicated problems for which you have no basic idea, but with the help of the \\ndivide and conquer approach, it has lessened the effort as it works on dividing the \\nmain problem into two halves and then solve them recursively. This algorithm is \\nmuch faster than other algorithms. \\no It efficiently uses cache memory without occupying much space because it solves \\nsimple subproblems within the cache memory instead of accessing the slower \\nmain memory. \\nDisadvantages of Divide and Conquer \\no Since most of its algorithms are designed by incorporating recursion, so it \\nnecessitates high memory management. \\no An explicit stack may overuse the space. \\no It may even crash the system if the recursion is performed rigorously greater than \\nthe stack present in the CPU. \\n1.11.2 Backtracking \\nIntroduction \\nThe Backtracking is an algorithmic-method to solve a problem with an additional way. It \\nuses a recursive approach to explain the problems. We can say that the backtracking is \\nneeded to find all possible combination to solve an optimization problem. \\nBacktracking is a systematic way of trying out different sequences of decisions until we \\nfind one that \"works.\" \\nIn the following Figure: \\no Each non-leaf node in a tree is a parent of one or more other nodes (its children) \\no Each node in the tree, other than the root, has exactly one parent \\n\\n\\nPage 28:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nGenerally, however, we draw our trees downward, with the root at the top. \\n \\n \\nA tree is composed of nodes. \\n\\n\\nPage 29:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nBacktracking can understand of as searching a tree for a particular \"goal\" leaf \\nnode. \\nBacktracking is undoubtedly quite simple - we \"explore\" each node, as follows: \\nTo \"explore\" node N: \\n 1. If N is a goal node, return \"success\" \\n 2. If N is a leaf node, return \"failure\" \\n 3. For each child C of N, \\n     Explore C \\n     If C was successful, return \"success\" \\n 4. Return \"failure\" \\nBacktracking algorithm determines the solution by systematically searching the solution \\nspace for the given problem. Backtracking is a depth-first search with any bounding \\nfunction. All solution using backtracking is needed to satisfy a complex set of constraints. \\nThe constraints may be explicit or implicit. \\nExplicit Constraint is ruled, which restrict each vector element to be chosen from the \\ngiven set. \\nImplicit Constraint is ruled, which determine which each of the tuples in the solution \\nspace, actually satisfy the criterion function. \\n\\n\\nPage 30:\\n \\n \\n \\n1.11.3 Dynamic programming \\nDynamic Programming Technique is similar to divide-and-conquer technique. Both \\ntechniques solve a problem by breaking it down into several sub-problems that can be \\nsolved recursively. The main difference between is that, Divide & Conquer approach \\npartitions the problems into independent sub-problems, solve the sub-problems \\nrecursively, and then combine their solutions to solve the original problems. Whereas \\ndynamic programming is applicable when the sub-problems are not independent, that is, \\nwhen sub-problems share sub subproblems. Also, A dynamic programming algorithms \\nsolves every sub problem just once and then saves its answer in a table, thereby avoiding \\nthe work of recomputing the answer every time the sub subproblems is encountered. \\nTherefore \"Dynamic programming is a applicable when sub problem are not \\nindependent, that is when sub problem share sub problems.\"  \\nAs Greedy approach, Dynamic programming is typically applied to optimization \\nproblems and for them there can be many possible solutions and the requirement is to \\nfind the optimal solution among those. But Dynamic programming approach is little \\ndifferent greedy approach. In greedy solutions are computed by making choices in serial \\nforward way and in this no backtracking & revision of choices is done where as Dynamic \\nprogramming computes its solution bottom up by producing them from smaller sub \\nproblems, and by trying many possibilities and choices before it arrives at the optimal set \\nof choices.  \\nThe Development of a dynamic-programming algorithm can be broken into a sequence of \\nfour steps: \\nDivide, Sub problems: The main problems are divided into several smaller sub \\nproblems. In this the solution of the main problem is expressed in terms of the solution \\nfor the smaller sub problems. Basically, it is all about characterizing the structure of an \\noptimal solution and recursively define the value of an optimal solution. \\nTable, Storage: The solution for each sub problem is stored in a table, so that it can be \\nused many times whenever required. \\nCombine, bottom-up Computation: The solution to main problem is obtained by \\ncombining the solutions of smaller sub problems. i.e., compute the value of an optimal \\nsolution in a bottom-up fashion. \\nConstruct an optimal solution from computed information. (This step is optional and is \\nrequired in case if some additional information is required after finding out optimal \\nsolution.) \\nNow for any problem to be solved through dynamic programming approach it must \\nfollow the following conditions: \\n\\n\\nPage 31:\\n \\n \\nPrinciple of Optimality: It states that for solving the master problem optimally, its sub \\nproblems should be solved optimally. It should be noted that not all the times each sub \\nproblem(s) is solved optimally, so in that case we should go for optimal majority. \\nPolynomial Breakup: For solving the main problem, the problem is divided into several \\nsub problems and for efficient performance of dynamic programming the total number of \\nsub problems to be solved should be at-most a polynomial number. \\nVarious algorithms which make use of Dynamic programming technique are as follows: \\n1. Knapsack problem. \\n2. Chain matrix multiplication. \\n3. All pair shortest path. \\n4. Travelling sales man problem. \\n5. Tower of hanoi. \\n6. Checker Board. \\n7. Fibonacci Sequence. \\n8. Assembly line scheduling. \\n9. Optimal binary search trees. \\n \\n \\n1.12 SUMMARY \\nA data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data either in computer’s \\nmemory or on the disk storage so that it can be used efficiently.  \\nThere are two types of data structures: primitive and non-primitive data structures. \\nPrimitive data structures are the fundamental data types which are supported by a \\nprogramming language. Nonprimitive data structures are those data structures which are \\ncreated using primitive data structures.  \\nNon-primitive data structures can further be classified into two categories: linear and \\nnon-linear data structures.  \\nIf the elements of a data structure are stored in a linear or sequential order, then it is a \\nlinear data structure. However, if the elements of a data structure are not stored in \\nsequential order, then it is a non-linear data structure.  \\nAn array is a collection of similar data elements which are stored in consecutive memory \\nlocations.  \\nA linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a group of elements (called nodes) \\nwhich together represent a sequence.  \\nA stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure in which insertion and deletion of \\nelements are done at only one end, which is known as the top of the stack.  \\nA queue is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure in which the element that is inserted \\nfirst is the first to be taken out. The elements in a queue are added at one end called the \\nrear and removed from the other end called the front. \\n\\n\\nPage 32:\\n \\n \\nA tree is a non-linear data structure which consists of a collection of nodes arranged in a \\nhierarchical tree structure.  \\nA graph is often viewed as a generalization of the tree structure, where instead of a purely \\nparent-to-child relationship between tree nodes, any kind of complex relationships can \\nexist between the nodes.  \\nAn abstract data type (ADT) is the way we look at a data structure, focusing on what it \\ndoes and ignoring how it does its job.  \\nAn algorithm is basically a set of instructions that solve a problem.  \\nThe time complexity of an algorithm is basically the running time of the program as a \\nfunction of the input size.  \\nThe space complexity of an algorithm is the amount of computer memory required during \\nthe program execution as a function of the input size.  \\nThe worst-case running time of an algorithm is an upper bound on the running time for \\nany input.  \\nThe average-case running time specifies the expected behaviour of the algorithm when \\nthe input is randomly drawn from a given distribution.  \\nThe efficiency of an algorithm is expressed in terms of the number of elements that has to \\nbe processed and the type of the loop that is being used. \\n \\n \\n1.13 MODEL QUESTIONS \\n1.

If, they are not \\nmaintained in an alphabetical order we would not be able to search any number \\neffectively. \\nThere are two types of sorting: \\nInternal Sorting:  \\nIf all the data that is to be sorted can be adjusted at a time in the main memory, the \\ninternal sorting method is being performed. \\nExternal Sorting:  \\n\\n\\nPage 35:\\n \\n \\nWhen the data that is to be sorted cannot be accommodated in the memory at the same \\ntime and some has to be kept in auxiliary memory such as hard disk, floppy disk, \\nmagnetic tapes etc, then external sorting methods are performed. \\n \\nApplication of sorting \\n1. The sorting is useful in database applications for arranging the data in desired ORDER. \\n2. In the dictionary like applications the data is arranged in sorted order. \\n3.

If the element at the lower index is greater than the element at the \\nhigher index, the two elements are interchanged so that the element is placed before the \\nbigger one. This process will continue till the list of unsorted elements exhausts. \\n \\nThis procedure of sorting is called bubble sorting because elements ‘bubble’ to the \\ntop of the list. Note that at the end of the first pass, the largest element in the list will be \\nplaced at its proper position (i.e., at the end of the list). \\n \\nNote :If the elements are to be sorted in descending order, then in first pass the \\nsmallest element is movedto the highest index of the array. \\n \\n \\nExample  To discuss bubble sort in detail, let us consider an arrayA[]that has the \\nfollowingelements: \\n \\nA[] = {30, 52, 29, 87, 63, 27, 19, 54} \\n \\nPass 1: \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 36:\\n \\n \\n \\nCompare 30 and 52.

In \\nbubble sort, we have seen that there are N–1 passes in total. In the first pass, N–\\n1comparisons are made to place the highest element in its correct position. Then, in \\nPass 2, there are N–2 comparisons and the second highest element is placed in its \\nposition. Therefore, to compute the complexity of bubble sort, we need to calculate the \\ntotal number of comparisons. It can be given as: \\n \\nf(n) = (n – 1) + (n – 2) + (n – 3) + ..... + 3 + 2 + 1 \\n \\nf(n) = n (n – 1)/2 \\n \\nf(n) = n2/2 + O(n) = O(n2) \\n \\nTherefore, the complexity of bubble sort algorithm is O(n2). It means the time required \\nto execute bubble sort is proportional to n2, where n is the total number of elements in \\nthe array. \\n \\n2.2.2  INSERTION SORT \\n \\nInsertion sort is a very simple sorting algorithm in which the sorted array (or list) is built \\none element at a time. We all are familiar with this technique of sorting, as we usually \\nuse it for ordering a deck of cards while playing bridge. \\n \\nInsertion sort inserts each item into its proper place in the final list. In insertion sort , the \\nfirst iteration starts with comparison of 1st element with 0th element. In the second \\niteration 2nd element is compared with the 0th and 1st  element  and so on.

For example, if the largest \\nnumber is a 3 digit number then that list is sorted with 3 passes. \\nStep by Step Process \\nThe Radix sort algorithm is performed using the following steps... \\n\\uf0b7 \\nStep 1 - Define 10 queues each representing a bucket for each digit from 0 to 9. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nStep 2 - Consider the least significant digit of each number in the list which is to \\nbe sorted. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nStep 3 - Insert each number into their respective queue based on the least \\nsignificant digit. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nStep 4 - Group all the numbers from queue 0 to queue 9 in the order they have \\ninserted into their respective queues. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nStep 5 - Repeat from step 3 based on the next least significant digit. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nStep 6 - Repeat from step 2 until all the numbers are grouped based on the most \\nsignificant digit. \\n\\n\\nPage 57:\\n \\n \\n \\nAlgorithm for Radix Sort \\nAlgorithm for RadixSort (ARR, N) \\n \\nStep 1: Find the largest number in ARR as LARGE \\nStep 2: [INITIALIZE] SET NOP = Number of digits in LARGE \\nStep 3: SET PASS =  \\nStep 4: Repeat Step 5 while PASS <= NOP-1 \\nStep 5:SET I =  and INITIALIZE buckets \\nStep 6:Repeat Steps 7 to 9 while I<N-1 \\nStep 7:SET DIGIT \\n= digit at PASSth place in A[I] \\nStep 8:Add A[I] to the bucket numbered DIGIT \\nStep 9:INCEREMENT bucket count for bucket numbered DIGIT \\n                            [END OF LOOP] \\nStep 1 :Collect the numbers in the bucket \\n    [END OF LOOP] \\nStep 11: END \\n \\n \\nExample    Sort the numbers given below using radix sort. \\n \\n345, 654, 924, 123, 567, 472, 555, 808, 911 \\n \\nIn the first pass, the numbers are sorted according to the digit at ones place. The \\nbuckets are pictured upside down as shown below. \\n \\nAfter this pass, the numbers are collected bucket by bucket. The new list thus formed is \\nused as an input for the next pass. In the second pass, the numbers are sorted according to \\nthe digit at the tens place. The buckets are pictured upside down. \\n\\n\\nPage 58:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIn the third pass, the numbers are sorted according to the digit at the hundreds \\nplace. The buckets are pictured upside down. \\n \\n \\n \\nThe numbers are collected bucket by bucket. The new list thus formed is the \\nfinal sorted result. After the third pass, the list can be given as \\n \\n123, 345, 472, 555, 567, 654, 808, 911, 924. \\n \\n \\nAdvantages: \\no Radix sort algorithm is well known for its fastest sorting algorithm for \\nnumbers and even for strings of letters. \\no Radix sort algorithm is the most efficient algorithm for elements which \\nare arranged in descending order in an array. \\nDisadvantages: \\no Radix sort takes more space than other sorting algorithms.  \\no Poor efficieny for most elements which are already arranged in \\nascending order in an array. \\no When Radix sort algorithm is applied on very small sets of data(numbers \\nor strings), then algorithm runs in 0(n) asymptotic time. \\n\\n\\nPage 59:\\n \\n \\nProgram \\n1. \\n#include <stdio.h>   \\n2. \\nint largest(int a[]);   \\n3. \\nvoid radix_sort(int a[]);   \\n4. \\nvoid main()   \\n5. \\n{   \\n6. \\n    int i;   \\n7. \\n    int a[10]={90,23,101,45,65,23,67,89,34,23};        \\n8. \\n    radix_sort(a);     \\n9. \\n    printf(\"\\\\n The sorted array is: \\\\n\");   \\n10. \\n    for(i=0;i<10;i++)   \\n11. \\n        printf(\" %d\\\\t\", a[i]);   \\n12. \\n}   \\n13. \\n   \\n14. \\nint largest(int a[])   \\n15. \\n{      \\n16. \\n    int larger=a[0], i;    \\n17. \\n    for(i=1;i<10;i++)   \\n18. \\n    {   \\n19. \\n        if(a[i]>larger)   \\n20. \\n        larger = a[i];   \\n21. \\n    }   \\n22. \\n    return larger;   \\n23. \\n}   \\n24. \\nvoid radix_sort(int a[])   \\n25. \\n{   \\n26. \\n    int bucket[10][10], bucket_count[10];   \\n27. \\n    int i, j, k, remainder, NOP=0, divisor=1, larger, pass;   \\n28. \\n    larger = largest(a);   \\n29. \\n    while(larger>0)   \\n30. \\n    {   \\n31. \\n        NOP++;   \\n32. \\n        larger/=10;   \\n33. \\n    }   \\n\\n\\nPage 60:\\n \\n \\n34. \\n    for(pass=0;pass<NOP;pass++) // Initialize the buckets   \\n35. \\n    {   \\n36. \\n        for(i=0;i<10;i++)   \\n37. \\n        bucket_count[i]=0;   \\n38. \\n        for(i=0;i<10;i++)   \\n39. \\n        {   \\n40. \\n            // sort the numbers according to the digit at passth place             \\n41. \\n            remainder = (a[i]/divisor)%10;   \\n42. \\n            bucket[remainder][bucket_count[remainder]] = a[i];   \\n43. \\n            bucket_count[remainder] += 1;   \\n44. \\n        }   \\n45. \\n        // collect the numbers after PASS pass   \\n46. \\n        i=0;   \\n47. \\n        for(k=0;k<10;k++)   \\n48. \\n        {   \\n49. \\n            for(j=0;j<bucket_count[k];j++)   \\n50. \\n            {   \\n51. \\n                a[i] = bucket[k][j];   \\n52. \\n                i++;   \\n53. \\n            }   \\n54. \\n        }   \\n55. \\n        divisor *= 10;   \\n56. \\n       \\n57. \\n}   \\n58. \\n}   \\n \\nOutput: \\nThe sorted array is: \\n23 \\n23 \\n23 \\n34 \\n45 \\n65 \\n67 \\n89 \\n\\n\\nPage 61:\\n \\n \\n90 \\n101 \\n \\nComplexity of Radix Sort \\nTo sort an unsorted list with \\'n\\' number of elements, Radix sort algorithm needs the \\nfollowing complexities... \\nWorst Case : O(n) \\nBest Case : O(n) \\nAverage Case : O(n) \\n \\n \\n2.2.7 HEAP SORT \\n \\nA) Terms in Heap:  \\n  \\na) Heap:  \\nHeap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the following special heap\\n \\nproperties  \\n  \\nb) Shape Property:  \\nHeap data structure is always a complete Binary Tree, which means all levels of the tree \\nare fully filled. \\n \\n  \\nc) Heap Property:  \\n All nodes are either (greater than or equal to) or (less than or equal to) each of its \\nchildren. If the parent nodes are greater than their children, heap is called a Max-Heap, \\nand if the parent nodes are small than their child nodes, heap is called Min-Heap. \\n\\n\\nPage 62:\\n \\n \\n \\nB) Working of Heap Sort:  \\nInitially on receiving an unsorted list, the first step in heap sort is to create a Heap data \\nstructure (Max-Heap or Min-Heap). Once heap is built, the first element of the Heap I \\neither largest or smallest(depending upon Max-Heap or min-Heap), so put the first \\nelement of the heap in array. Then again make heap using the remaining elements, to \\nagain pick the first element of the heap and put it into the array. Keep on doing the same \\nrepeatedly until we have the complete sorted list in array. \\n \\nExample 2 : 4 ,1,3 ,2 ,16,9,10,14, 8,7 \\n\\n\\nPage 63:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nOperations on the heap : \\n \\n1. Inserting An Element into Heap : \\n \\nThe elements are always inserted at the bottom of the original heap. After \\ninsertion, the heap remains complete but the order property is not followed so we use \\nan UPHEAP or HEAPIFY operation. This involves moving the elements upward \\nfrom the last position where it satisfies the order property. If the value of last node is \\ngreater than its parent, exchange it’s value with it’s parent and repeat the process \\nwith each parent node until the order property is satisfied. \\n \\n2. Deleting an Element from Heap : \\n \\nElements are always deleted from the root of the heap. \\n \\nAlgorithm for insertion of element : \\nINHEAP (TREE, N, ITEM) \\n \\nA heap H with N elements is stored in the array TREE, and an item of information \\nis given.

This \\nprocedure is repeated until the whole array is sorted. \\n \\n Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that uses the divide, conquer, and combine \\nalgorithmic paradigm. Divide means partitioning the n-element array to be sorted into \\ntwo sub-arrays of n/2 elements in each sub-array. Conquer means sorting the two sub-\\narrays recursively using merge sort. Combine means merging the two sorted sub-\\narrays of size n/2 each to produce a sorted array of n elements. The running time of \\nmerge sort in average case and worst case can be given as O(n log n). \\n \\n Quick sort works by using a divide-and-conquer strategy. It selects a pivot element \\nand rearranges the elements in such a way that all elements less than pivot appear \\nbefore it and all elements greater than pivot appear after it. \\n \\n Radix sort is a linear sorting algorithm that uses the concept of sorting names in \\nalphabetical order. \\n  \\n Heap sort sorts an array in two phases.

If the element is \\npresent in the list, then the process is called successful and the process returns the \\nlocation of that element, otherwise the search is called unsuccessful. \\n3.2 SEARCHING TECHNIQUES \\nThere are two popular search methods that are widely used in order to search some item \\ninto the list. However, choice of the algorithm depends upon the arrangement of the list. \\no Linear Search \\no Binary Search \\n3.2.1  LINEAR SEARCH / SEQUENTIAL SEARCH \\n \\nLinear search, also called as sequential search, is a very simple method used for \\nsearching an array for a particular value. It works by comparing the value to be \\nsearched with every element of the array one by one in a sequence until a match is \\nfound.

It is likewise utilized in numerous encryption calculations.  \\nA hash code is produced by utilizing a key, which is an exceptional worth.  \\nHashing is a strategy where given key field esteem is changed over into the location \\nof capacity area of the record by applying a similar procedure on it.  \\n\\n\\nPage 95:\\n \\n \\nThe benefit of hashing is that permits the execution season of fundamental activity to \\nstay consistent in any event, for the bigger side. \\n4.2 Why we need Hashing? \\nAssume we have 50 workers, and we need to give 4 digit key to every representative \\n(with respect to security), and we need subsequent to entering a key, direct client \\nguide to a specific position where information is put away.  \\nIn the event that we give the area number as per 4 digits, we should hold 0000 to \\n9999 locations since anyone can utilize anybody as a key. There is a great deal of \\nwastage.  \\nTo tackle this issue, we use hashing which will deliver a more modest estimation of \\nthe record of the hash table relating to the key of the client. \\n4.3 Universal Hashing \\nLeave H alone a limited assortment of hash works that map a given universe U of \\nkeys into the reach {0, 1..... m-1}. Such an assortment is supposed to be all inclusive \\nif for each pair of particular keys k,l∈U, the quantity of hash capacities h∈ H for \\nwhich h(k)= h(l) is all things considered |H|/m. As such, with a hash work \\nhaphazardly browsed H, the possibility of an impact between particular keys k and l \\nis close to the opportunity 1/m of a crash if h(k) and h(l)were arbitrarily and \\nautonomously looked over the set {0,1,...m-1}. \\n4.4.Rehashing \\nOn the off chance that any stage the hash table turns out to be almost full, the running \\ntime for the activities of will begin taking an excess of time, embed activity may fall \\nflat in such circumstance, the most ideal arrangement is as per the following:  \\n1. Make another hash table twofold in size.  \\n2. Output the first hash table, register new hash worth and addition into the new \\nhash table.  \\n3. Free the memory involved by the first hash table.  \\n \\nModel: Consider embeddings the keys 10, 22, 31,4,15,28,17,88 and 59 into a hash \\ntable of length m = 11 utilizing open tending to with the essential hash work h\\' (k) = k \\nmod m .Illustrate the aftereffect of embeddings these keys utilizing straight \\nexamining, utilizing quadratic testing with c1=1 and c2=3, and utilizing twofold \\nhashing with h2(k) = 1 + (k mod (m-1)).  \\nArrangement: Using Linear Probing the last condition of hash table would be: \\n\\n\\nPage 96:\\n \\n \\n \\nUsing Quadratic Probing with c1=1, c2=3, the final state of hash table would be h (k, \\ni) = (h\\' (k) +c1*i+ c2 *i2) mod m where m=11 and h\\' (k) = k mod m. \\n \\nUsing Double Hashing, the final state of the hash table would be: \\n\\n\\nPage 97:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n4.5 Hash Tables \\nIt is an assortment of things which are put away so as to make it simple to discover \\nthem later.  \\nEach position in the hash table is called opening, can hold a thing and is named by a \\nnumber worth beginning at 0.  \\nThe planning between a thing and a space where the thing should be in a hash table is \\nknown as a Hash Function. A hash Function acknowledges a key and returns its hash \\ncoding, or hash esteem.  \\nExpect we have a bunch of whole numbers 54, 26, 93, 17, 77, 31. Our first hash work \\nneeded to be as \"leftover portion strategy\" just takes the thing and separation it by \\ntable size, returning remaining portion as its hash esteem for example \\nh item = item % (size of table)    \\nLet us say the size of table = 11, then   \\n54 % 11 = 10   26 % 11 = 4    93 % 11 = 5   \\n17 % 11 = 6    77 % 11 = 0    31 % 11 = 9      \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 98:\\n \\n \\n \\nNow when we need to search any element, we just need to divide it by the table size, \\nand we get the hash value. So we get the O (1) search time. \\nNow taking one more element 44 when we apply the hash function on 44, we get (44 \\n% 11 = 0), But 0 hash value already has an element 77. This Problem is called as \\nCollision. \\nCollision: According to the Hash Function, two or more item would need in the same \\nslot. This is said to be called as Collision. \\n \\nFigure: using a hash function h to map keys to hash-table slots. Because keys K2 and \\nk5 map to the same slot, they collide. \\n4.6.Why use HashTable? \\n1. If U (Universe of keys) is large, storing a table T of size [U] may be \\nimpossible. \\n2. Set k of keys may be small relative to U so space allocated for T will waste. \\nSo Hash Table requires less storage. Indirect addressing element with key k is stored \\nin slot k with hashing it is stored in h (k) where h is a hash fn and hash (k) is the \\nvalue of key k. Hash fn required array range. \\n4.7.Application of Hash Tables: \\nSome use of Hash Tables are:  \\n\\n\\nPage 99:\\n \\n \\n1. Data set System: Specifically, those that are required effective arbitrary \\naccess. Generally, information base frameworks attempt to create between \\ntwo sorts of access techniques: successive and arbitrary. Hash Table is an \\nessential piece of proficient arbitrary access since they give an approach to \\nfind information in a consistent measure of time.  \\n2. Image Tables: The tables used by compilers to keep up information about \\nimages from a program. Compilers access data about images much of the \\ntime. In this manner, it is fundamental that image tables be actualized \\nproductively.  \\n3. Information Dictionaries: Data Structure that supports adding, erasing, and \\nlooking for information. Albeit the activity of hash tables and an information \\nword reference are comparable, other Data Structures might be utilized to \\nactualize information word references.  \\n4. Cooperative Arrays: Associative Arrays comprise of information orchestrated \\nso nth components of one exhibit compare to the nth component of another. \\nCooperative Arrays are useful for ordering a consistent gathering of \\ninformation by a few key fields. \\n4.8 .Methods of Hashing \\nThere are two main methods used to implement hashing: \\n2.4.1.Hashing with Chaining \\n2.4.2.Hashing with open addressing \\n4.8.1.Hashing with Chaining \\nIn Hashing with Chaining, the component in S is put away in Hash table T [0...m-\\n1] of size m, where m is to some degree bigger than n, the size of S. The hash \\ntable is said to have m spaces. Related with the hashing plan is a hash work h \\nwhich is planning from U to {0...m-1}.Each key k ∈S is put away in area T [h \\n(k)], and we say that k is hashed into opening h (k). In the event that more than \\none key in S hashed into a similar opening, we have a crash.  \\nIn such case, all keys that hash into a similar space are put in a connected \\nrundown related with that opening, this connected rundown is known as the chain \\nat opening. The heap factor of a hash table is characterized to be ∝=n/m it \\naddresses the normal number of keys per opening. We normally work in the reach \\nm=θ(n), so ∝ is typically a consistent by and large ∝<1. \\n\\n\\nPage 100:\\n \\n \\n \\n4.8.2.Collision Resolution by Chaining: \\n \\nIn anchoring, we place all the components that hash to a similar opening into a \\nsimilar connected rundown, As fig shows that Slot j contains a pointer to the top of \\nthe rundown of all put away components that hash to j ; if there are no such \\ncomponents, space j contains NIL. \\n \\nEach hash-table slot T [j] contains a linked list of all the keys whose hash value is j. \\nFor example, h (k1) = h (k4) and h (k5) = h (k7) =h (K2). The linked list can be either \\nsingly or doubly linked; we show it as doubly linked because deletion is faster that \\nway. \\n \\n4.8.3. Analysis of Hashing with Chaining: \\nGiven a hash table T with m spaces that stores n components, we characterize the \\nheap factors α for T as n/m that is the normal number of components put away in a \\nchain. The most pessimistic scenario running time for looking is in this manner θ(n) \\nin addition to an opportunity to figure the hash work no better compared to on the off \\nchance that we utilized one connected rundown for all the components. Obviously, \\nhash tables are not utilized for their most pessimistic scenario execution.  \\nThe normal presentation of hashing relies upon how well the hash work h circulates \\nthe arrangement of keys to be put away among the m openings, all things considered.  \\n\\n\\nPage 101:\\n \\n \\nModel: let us think about the inclusion of components 5, 28, 19,15,20,33,12,17,10 \\ninto an anchored hash table. Allow us to assume the hash table has 9 openings and the \\nhash work be h (k) =k mod 9.  \\nArrangement: The underlying condition of tied hash table \\n \\nInsert 5: \\nh (5) = 5 mod 9 =5   \\nCreate a linked list for T [5] and store value 5 in it. \\n \\nSimilarly, insert 28. h (28) = 28 mod 9 =1. Create a Linked List for T [1] and store \\nvalue 28 in it. Now insert 19 h (19) = 19 mod 9 = 1. Insert value 19 in the slot T [1] at \\nthe beginning of the linked-list. \\n\\n\\nPage 102:\\n \\n \\n \\nNow insert h 15, h (15) = 15 mod 9 = 6. Create a link list for T [6] and store value 15 \\nin it.   \\nSimilarly, insert 20, h (20) = 20 mod 9 = 2 in T [2].   \\nInsert 33, h (33) = 33 mod 9 = 6   \\nIn the beginning of the linked list T [6]. Then,   \\n  Insert 12, h (12) = 12 mod 9 = 3 in T [3].   \\n    Insert 17, h (17) = 17 mod 9 = 8 in T [8].   \\n    Insert 10, h (10) = 10 mod 9 = 1 in T [1].   \\nThus the chained- hash- table after inserting key 10 is \\n \\n \\n4.9.Hashing with Open Addressing \\nIn Open Addressing, all components are put away in hash table itself. That is, each \\ntable passage comprises of a segment of the powerful set or NIL. While looking for a \\nthing, we reliably analyze table openings until possibly we locate the ideal article or \\nwe have verified that the component isn\\'t in the table. Accordingly, in open tending \\nto, the heap factor α can never surpass 1.  \\n \\nThe upside of open tending to is that it dodges Pointer. In this, we figure the grouping \\nof spaces to be inspected. The additional memory liberated by not sharing pointers \\nfurnishes the hash table with a bigger number of openings for a similar measure of \\nmemory, conceivably yielding less crash and quicker recovery.  \\nThe way toward looking at the area in the hash table is called Probing.  \\n\\n\\nPage 103:\\n \\n \\nIn this manner, the hash work becomes \\nh : U x {0,1,....m-1}  →  {0,1,....,m-1}.     \\nWith open addressing, we require that for every key k, the probe sequence \\n \\n{h, (k, 0), h (k, 1)....h (k, m-1)}   \\nBe a Permutation of (0, 1...... m-1)   \\nThe HASH-INSERT procedure takes as input a hash table T and a key k \\n \\nHASH-INSERT (T, k) \\n 1. i ← 0 \\n 2. repeat j ← h (k, i) \\n 3. if T [j] = NIL \\n 4. then T [j] ← k \\n 5. return j \\n 6. else ← i= i +1 \\n 7. untili=m \\n 8. error \"hash table overflow\" \\nThe procedure HASH-SEARCH takes as input a hash table T and a key k, returning j \\nif it finds that slot j contains key k or NIL if key k is not present in table T. \\n \\nHASH-SEARCH.T (k) \\n 1. i ← 0 \\n 2. repeat j ← h (k, i) \\n 3. if T [j] =j \\n 4. then return j \\n 5. i ← i+1 \\n 6. until T [j] = NIL or i=m \\n 7. return NIL \\n \\n \\n4.10 Open Addressing Techniques \\nThree techniques are commonly used to compute the probe sequence required for \\nopen addressing: \\n4.10.1.Linear Probing. \\n4.10.2.Quadratic Probing. \\n4.10.3.Double Hashing. \\n\\n\\nPage 104:\\n \\n \\n4.10.1. Linear Probing: \\nIt is a Scheme in Computer Programming for settling impact in hash tables.  \\nAssume another record R with key k is to be added to the memory table T however \\nthat the memory areas with the hash address H (k). H is as of now filled.  \\nOur regular key to determine the impact is to intersection R to the most readily \\naccessible area following T (h). We accept that the table T with m area is round, so T \\n[i] comes after T [m].  \\nThe above impact goal is designated \"Direct Probing\".  \\nDirect examining is easy to execute, yet it experiences an issue known as essential \\ngrouping. Long runs of involved spaces develop, expanding the normal pursuit time. \\nBunches emerge on the grounds that a vacant space continued by I full openings gets \\nfilled next with likelihood (I + 1)/m. Long runs of involved spaces will in general get \\nlonger, and the normal hunt time increments.  \\nGiven a normal hash work h\\': U {0, 1...m-1}, the technique for direct examining \\nutilizes the hash work. \\nh (k, i) = (h\\' (k) + i) mod m   \\nWhere \\'m\\' is the size of hash table and h\\' (k) = k mod m. for i=0, 1....m-1. \\nGiven key k, the first slot is T [h\\' (k)]. We next slot T [h\\' (k) +1] and so on up to the \\nslot T [m-1]. Then we wrap around to slots T [0], T [1]....until finally slot T [h\\' (k)-1]. \\nSince the initial probe position dispose of the entire probe sequence, only m distinct \\nprobe sequences are used with linear probing. \\nExample: Consider inserting the keys 24, 36, 58,65,62,86 into a hash table of size \\nm=11 using linear probing, consider the primary hash function is h\\' (k) = k mod m. \\nSolution: Initial state of hash table \\n \\nInsert 24. We know h (k, i) = [h\\' (k) + i] mod m \\nNow h (24, 0) = [24 mod 11 + 0] mod 11 \\n \\n \\n= (2+0) mod 11 = 2 mod 11 = 2 \\nSince T [2] is free, insert key 24 at this place. \\n \\nInsert 36. Now h (36, 0) = [36 mod 11 + 0] mod 11 \\n \\n \\n= [3+0] mod 11 = 3 \\nSince T [3] is free, insert key 36 at this place. \\n \\nInsert 58. Now h (58, 0) = [58 mod 11 +0] mod 11 \\n \\n \\n= [3+0] mod 11 =3 \\nSince T [3] is not free, so the next sequence is  \\n \\n \\nh (58, 1) = [58 mod 11 +1] mod 11 \\n \\n \\n= [3+1] mod 11= 4 mod 11=4 \\nT [4] is free; Insert key 58 at this place. \\n \\nInsert 65. Now h (65, 0) = [65 mod 11 +0] mod 11 \\n\\n\\nPage 105:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n= (10 +0) mod 11= 10 \\nT [10] is free. Insert key 65 at this place. \\n \\nInsert 62. Now h (62, 0) = [62 mod 11 +0] mod 11 \\n \\n \\n= [7 + 0] mod 11 = 7 \\nT [7] is free. Insert key 62 at this place. \\n \\nInsert 86. Now h (86, 0) = [86 mod 11 + 0] mod 11 \\n \\n \\n= [9 + 0] mod 11 = 9 \\nT [9] is free. Insert key 86 at this place. \\n Thus, \\n \\n \\n4.10.2.Quadratic Probing: \\nAssume a record R with key k has the hash address H (k) = h then as opposed to \\nlooking through the area with addresses h, h+1, and h+ 2...We directly search the \\nareas with addresses  \\nh, h+1, h+4, h+9...h+i2  \\n \\nQuadratic Probing uses a hash capacity of the structure  \\n \\nh (k,i) = (h\\' (k) + c1i + c2i2) mod m  \\n \\nWhere (as in direct testing) h\\' is a helper hash work c1 and c2 ≠0 are assistant \\nconstants and i=0, 1...m-1. The underlying position is T [h\\' (k)]; later position \\ntested is counterbalanced by the sum that depend in a quadratic way on the \\ntest number I.  \\n \\nModel: Consider embeddings the keys 74, 28, 36,58,21,64 into a hash table of \\nsize m =11 utilizing quadratic examining with c1=1 and c2=3. Further \\nconsider that the essential hash work is h\\' (k) = k mod m.  \\n \\nArrangement: For Quadratic Probing, we have \\n \\nh (k, i) = [k mod m +c1i +c2 i2) mod m \\n \\nThis is the initial state of hash table \\n \\nHere c1= 1 and c2=3 \\nh (k, i) = [k mod m + i + 3i2 ] mod m \\n\\n\\nPage 106:\\n \\n \\nInsert 74. \\n \\n \\nh (74,0)= (74 mod 11+0+3x0) mod 11 \\n \\n      = (8 +0+0) mod 11 = 8 \\nT [8] is free; insert the key 74 at this place. \\n \\nInsert 28. \\n \\nh (28, 0) = (28 mod 11 + 0 + 3 x 0) mod 11 \\n               = (6 +0 + 0) mod 11 = 6. \\nT [6] is free; insert key 28 at this place. \\n \\nInsert 36. \\n \\n \\nh (36, 0) = (36 mod 11 + 0 + 3 x 0) mod 11 \\n \\n \\n  = (3 + 0+0) mod 11=3 \\nT [3] is free; insert key 36 at this place. \\n \\nInsert 58. \\n \\n \\nh (58, 0) = (58 mod 11 + 0 + 3 x 0) mod 11 \\n \\n          = (3 + 0 + 0) mod 11 = 3 \\nT [3] is not free, so next probe sequence is computed as  \\n \\nh (59, 1) = (58 mod 11 + 1 + 3 x12) mod 11 \\n                  = (3 + 1 + 3) mod 11 \\n \\n \\n  =7 mod 11= 7 \\nT [7] is free; insert key 58 at this place. \\n \\nInsert 21. \\n \\n \\nh (21, 0) = (21 mod 11 + 0 + 3 x 0) \\n \\n \\n  = (10 + 0) mod 11 = 10 \\nT [10] is free; insert key 21 at this place. \\n \\n \\nInsert 64. \\n \\n \\nh (64, 0) = (64 mod 11 + 0 + 3 x 0) \\n \\n \\n  = (9 + 0+ 0) mod 11 = 9. \\nT [9] is free; insert key 64 at this place. \\nThus, after inserting all keys, the hash table is \\n\\n\\nPage 107:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n4.10.3.Double Hashing: \\nDouble Hashing is one of the best techniques available for open addressing because \\nthe permutations produced have many of the characteristics of randomly chosen \\npermutations. \\n \\nDouble hashing uses a hash function of the form \\n \\nh (k, i) = (h1(k) + i h2 (k)) mod m \\nWhere h1 and h2 are auxiliary hash functions and m is the size of the hash table. \\n \\nh1 (k) = k mod m or h2 (k) = k mod m\\'. Here m\\' is slightly less than m (say m-1 or m-\\n2). \\n \\nExample: Consider inserting the keys 76, 26, 37,59,21,65 into a hash table of size m \\n= 11 using double hashing. Consider that the auxiliary hash functions are h1 (k)=k \\nmod 11 and h2(k) = k mod 9. \\n \\nSolution: Initial state of Hash table is \\n \\n \\n1. Insert 76. \\nh1(76) = 76 mod 11 = 10 \\nh2(76) = 76 mod 9 = 4 \\nh (76, 0) = (10 + 0 x 4) mod 11 \\n \\n \\n \\n      = 10 mod 11 = 10 \\nT [10] is free, so insert key 76 at this place. \\n \\n2. Insert 26. \\n \\nh1(26) = 26 mod 11 = 4 \\nh2(26) = 26 mod 9 = 8 \\nh (26, 0) = (4 + 0 x 8) mod 11 \\n \\n \\n \\n      = 4 mod 11 = 4 \\nT [4] is free, so insert key 26 at this place. \\n \\n3. Insert 37. \\n \\nh1(37) = 37 mod 11 = 4 \\nh2(37) = 37 mod 9 = 1 \\nh (37, 0) = (4 + 0 x 1) mod 11 = 4 mod 11 = 4 \\n\\n\\nPage 108:\\n \\n \\nT [4] is not free, the next probe sequence is  \\n \\n \\nh (37, 1) = (4 + 1 x 1) mod 11 = 5 mod 11 = 5 \\nT [5] is free, so insert key 37 at this place. \\n \\n4. Insert 59. \\n \\nh1(59) = 59 mod 11 = 4 \\nh2(59) = 59 mod 9 = 5 \\nh (59, 0) = (4 + 0 x 5) mod 11 = 4 mod 11 = 4 \\nSince, T [4] is not free, the next probe sequence is  \\nh (59, 1) = (4 + 1 x 5) mod 11 = 9 mod 11 = 9 \\nT [9] is free, so insert key 59 at this place. \\n \\n \\n5. Insert 21. \\n \\nh1(21) = 21 mod 11 = 10 \\n \\nh2(21) = 21 mod 9 = 3 \\n \\n \\nh (21, 0) = (10 + 0 x 3) mod 11 = 10 mod 11 = \\n10 \\nT [10] is not free, the next probe sequence is \\n \\n \\nh (21, 1) = (10 + 1 x 3) mod 11 = 13 mod 11 = 2 \\nT [2] is free, so insert key 21 at this place. \\n \\n6. Insert 65. \\n \\nh1(65) = 65 mod 11 = 10 \\nh2(65) = 65 mod 9 = 2 \\n \\n \\n \\nh (65, 0) = (10 + 0 x 2) mod 11 = 10 \\nmod 11 = 10 \\nT [10] is not free, the next probe sequence is \\n \\n \\n \\nh (65, 1) = (10 + 1 x 2) mod 11 = 12 \\nmod 11 = 1 \\nT [1] is free, so insert key 65 at this place. \\nThus, after insertion of all keys the final hash table is \\n \\n \\n \\n4.11 Hash Function \\nHash Function is utilized to list the first worth or key and afterward utilized later each \\ntime the information related with the worth or key is to be recovered. Along these \\nlines, hashing is consistently a single direction activity. There is no compelling \\nreason to \"figure out\" the hash work by examining the hashed values. \\n4.12Characteristics of Good Hash Function: \\n1. The hash esteem is completely dictated by the information being hashed.  \\n2. The hash Function utilizes all the information.  \\n3. The hash work \"consistently\" conveys the information across the whole \\narrangement of conceivable hash esteems.  \\n4. The hash work creates convoluted hash esteems for comparative strings. \\n\\n\\nPage 109:\\n \\n \\n4.13 Some Popular Hash Function is: \\n4.13.1. Division Method:Pick a number m more modest than the quantity of n of \\nkeys in k (The number m is typically picked to be an indivisible number or a number \\nwithout little divisors, since this often a base number of crashes).  \\n \\nThe hash work is:  \\n \\nFor Example: if the hash table has size m = 12 and the key is k = 100, at that point h \\n(k) = 4. Since it requires just a solitary division activity, hashing by division is very \\nquick. \\n4.13.2. Duplication Method:  \\nThe increase technique for making hash capacities works in two stages. In the first \\nplace, we increase the vital k by a steady An in the reach 0 < A < 1 and concentrate \\nthe fragmentary piece of kA. At that point, we increment this incentive by m and take \\nthe floor of the outcome.  \\nThe hash work is: \\n \\nWhere \"k A mod 1\" means the fractional part of k A, that is, k A -⌊k A⌋. \\n \\n4.13.3. Mid Square Method: \\nThe key k is squared. Then function H is defined by \\n \\nH (k) = L   \\nWhere L is obtained by deleting digits from both ends of k2. We emphasize that the \\nsame position of k2 must be used for all of the keys. \\n \\n4.13.4.Folding Method: \\nThe key k is partitioned into a number of parts k1, k2.... kn where each part except \\npossibly the last, has the same number of digits as the required address. \\n \\nThen the parts are added together, ignoring the last carry. \\n \\nH (k) = k1+ k2+.....+kn \\nExample: Company has 68 employees, and each is assigned a unique four- digit \\nemployee number.

Stack has one end, though the Queue has two finishes (front and back). It \\ncontains just a single pointer top pointer highlighting the highest component of the \\nstack. At whatever point a component is included the stack, it is added on the highest \\npoint of the stack, and the component can be erased uniquely from the stack. All in \\nall, a stack can be characterized as a compartment in which inclusion and erasure \\nshould be possible from the one end known as the highest point of the stack. \\nSome key points related to stack \\no \\nIt is called as stack since it carries on like a certifiable stack, heaps of books, \\nand so forth  \\n\\n\\nPage 112:\\n \\n \\no \\nA Stack is a theoretical information type with a pre-characterized limit, which \\nimplies that it can store the components of a restricted size.  \\no \\nIt is an information structure that follows some request to embed and erase the \\ncomponents, and that request can be LIFO or FILO. \\n5.2.Working of Stack  \\nStack chips away at the LIFO design. As we can see in the underneath figure there \\nare five memory blocks in the stack; along these lines, the size of the stack is 5.  \\nAssume we need to store the components in a stack and how about we expect that \\nstack is vacant. We have taken the pile of size 5 as appeared underneath in which we \\nare pushing the components individually until the stack turns out to be full. \\n \\nSince our stack is full as the size of the stack is 5. In the above cases, we can see that \\nit goes from the top to the base when we were entering the new component in the \\nstack. The stack gets topped off from the base to the top.  \\nAt the point when we play out the erase procedure on the stack, there is just a single \\nroute for passage and exit as the opposite end is shut. It follows the LIFO design, \\nwhich implies that the worth entered first will be eliminated last. In the above case, \\nthe worth 5 is entered first, so it will be taken out simply after the cancellation of the \\nmultitude of different components. \\n \\n5.3. Standard Stack Operations  \\nComing up next are some basic activities actualized on the stack:  \\no \\npush(): When we embed a component in a stack then the activity is known as \\na push. On the off chance that the stack is full, at that point the flood condition \\nhappens.  \\no \\npop(): When we erase a component from the stack, the activity is known as a \\npop. In the event that the stack is unfilled implies that no component exists in the \\nstack, this state is known as an undercurrent state.  \\no \\nisEmpty(): It decides if the stack is unfilled or not.  \\no \\nisFull(): It decides if the stack is full or not.\\'  \\no \\npeek(): It restores the component at the given position.  \\no \\ncount(): It restores the all out number of components accessible in a stack.  \\no \\nchange(): It changes the component at the given position.  \\n\\n\\nPage 113:\\n \\n \\no \\ndisplay(): It prints all the components accessible in the stack. \\n \\n5.3.1.  PUSH operation \\nThe means engaged with the PUSH activity is given beneath:  \\no \\nBefore embeddings a component in a stack, we check whether the stack is \\nfull.  \\no \\nIf we attempt to embed the component in a stack, and the stack is full, at that \\npoint the flood condition happens.  \\no \\nWhen we introduce a stack, we set the estimation of top as - 1 to watch that \\nthe stack is unfilled.  \\no \\nWhen the new component is pushed in a stack, first, the estimation of the top \\ngets increased, i.e., top=top+1, and the component will be put at the new situation of \\nthe top.  \\no \\nThe components will be embedded until we arrive at the maximum size of the \\nstack.\\n \\n5.3.2. POP operation \\nThe means engaged with the POP activity is given beneath:  \\no \\nBefore erasing the component from the stack, we check whether the stack is \\nvacant.  \\no \\nIf we attempt to erase the component from the vacant stack, at that point the \\nsub-current condition happens.  \\no \\nIf the stack isn\\'t unfilled, we first access the component which is pointed by \\nthe top  \\n\\n\\nPage 114:\\n \\n \\no \\nOnce the pop activity is played out, the top is decremented by 1, i.e., top=top-\\n \\n5.4. Applications of Stack \\nThe following are the applications of the stack: \\nBalancing of symbols: Stack is used for balancing a symbol. For example, we have \\nthe following program: \\nint main()   \\n{   \\ncout<<\"Hello\";   \\ncout<<\"Data Structure\";   \\n}   \\nAs we probably are aware, each program has an opening and shutting supports; when \\nthe initial supports come, we push the supports in a stack, and when the end supports \\nshow up, we pop the initial supports from the stack. Subsequently, the net worth \\ncomes out to be zero. In the event that any image is left in the stack, it implies that \\nsome language structure happens in a program.  \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 115:\\n \\n \\no \\nString inversion: Stack is additionally utilized for switching a string. For \\ninstance, we need to switch a \"Information Structure\" string, so we can accomplish \\nthis with the assistance of a stack.  \\n \\nTo start with, we push all the characters of the string in a stack until we arrive at the \\ninvalid character.  \\n \\nIn the wake of pushing all the characters, we begin taking out the character \\nindividually until we arrive at the lower part of the stack.  \\n \\no \\nUNDO/REDO: It can likewise be utilized for performing UNDO/REDO \\ntasks. For instance, we have a manager where we compose \\'a\\', at that point \\'b\\', and \\nafterward \\'c\\'; hence, the content written in a supervisor is abc. Thus, there are three \\nexpresses, a, stomach muscle, and abc, which are put away in a stack. There would be \\ntwo stacks in which one stack shows UNDO state, and different shows REDO state.  \\n \\nIn the event that we need to perform UNDO activity, and need to accomplish \\n\\'stomach muscle\\' state, at that point we actualize pop activity.  \\n \\no \\nRecursion: The recursion implies that the capacity is calling itself once more. \\nTo keep up the past states, the compiler makes a framework stack in which all the \\npast records of the capacity are kept up.  \\n \\no \\nDFS(Depth First Search): This hunt is actualized on a Graph, and Graph \\nutilizes the stack information structure.  \\n \\no \\nBacktracking: Suppose we need to make a way to tackle a labyrinth issue. In \\nthe event that we are moving in a specific way, and we understand that we please the \\nincorrect way. To come toward the start of the way to make another way, we need to \\nutilize the stack information structure.  \\n \\no \\nExpression change: Stack can likewise be utilized for articulation \\ntransformation. This is perhaps the main utilizations of stack. The rundown of the \\narticulation change is given underneath:Infix to prefix \\nInfix to postfix \\nPrefix to infix \\nPrefix to postfix \\nPostfix to infix \\no \\nMemory the board: The stack deals with the memory. The memory is alloted \\nin the touching memory blocks. The memory is referred to as stack memory as all the \\n\\n\\nPage 116:\\n \\n \\nfactors are allocated in a capacity call stack memory. The memory size alloted to the \\nprogram is known to the compiler. At the point when the capacity is made, every one \\nof its factors are doled out in the stack memory. At the point when the capacity \\nfinished its execution, all the factors doled out in the stack are delivered. \\n5.4.1. Cluster execution of Stack  \\nIn cluster execution, the stack is shaped by utilizing the exhibit. All the activities with \\nrespect to the stack are performed utilizing exhibits. Lets perceive how every activity \\ncan be actualized on the stack utilizing cluster information structure.  \\nAdding a component onto the stack (push activity)  \\nAdding a component into the highest point of the stack is alluded to as push activity. \\nPush activity includes following two stages.  \\n1. \\nIncrement the variable Top with the goal that it can now refere to the \\nfollowing memory area.  \\n2. \\nAdd component at the situation of increased top. This is alluded to as adding \\nnew component at the highest point of the stack.  \\nStack is overflown when we attempt to embed a component into a totally filled stack \\nthusly, our primary capacity should consistently stay away from stack flood \\ncondition. \\nAlgorithm: \\nbegin \\nif top = n then stack full    \\ntop = top + 1   \\nstack (top) : = item;   \\nend \\nTime Complexity : o(1) \\n5.4.2.

Visiting each element of the stack (Peek operation) \\nLook actKivity includes restoring the component which is available at the highest \\npoint of the stack without erasing it. Sub-current condition can happen in the event \\nthat we attempt to restore the top compo:.,nent in an all around void stack. \\nAlgorithm : \\nPEEK (STACK, TOP) \\nBegin    \\nif top = -1 then stack empty     \\nitem = stack[top]    \\nreturn item   \\nEnd     \\nTime complexity: o(n) \\n \\nImplementation of Peek algorithm in C language \\nint peek()   \\n{   \\nif (top == -1)    \\n    {   \\nprintf(\"Underflow\");   \\nreturn 0;    \\n    }   \\nelse \\n    {   \\nreturn stack [top];   \\n    }   \\n}   \\n \\n5.4.4.

Linked list implementation of stack \\nRather than utilizing cluster, we can likewise utilize connected rundown to execute \\nstack. Connected rundown assigns the memory powerfully. Nonetheless, time \\nunpredictability in both the situation is same for all the tasks for example push, pop \\nand look.  \\nIn connected rundown execution of stack, the hubs are kept up non-coterminously in \\nthe memory. Every hub contains a pointer to its nearby replacement hub in the stack. \\nStack is supposed to be overflown if the space left in the memory pile isn\\'t sufficient \\nto make a hub. \\n\\n\\nPage 120:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe top most hub in the stack consistently contains invalid in its location field. Lets \\nexamine the manner by which, every activity is acted in connected rundown usage of \\nstack. \\n5.5.1. Adding a node to the stack (Push operation) \\nAdding a hub to the stack is alluded to as push activity. Pushing a component to a \\nstack in connected rundown execution is not quite the same as that of a cluster usage. \\nTo push a component onto the stack, the accompanying advances are included.  \\n1. \\nCreate a hub first and designate memory to it.  \\n2. \\nIf the rundown is vacant then the thing is to be pushed as the beginning hub of \\nthe rundown. This incorporates doling out an incentive to the information part of the \\nhub and allot invalid to the location part of the hub.  \\n3. \\nIf there are a few hubs in the rundown effectively, at that point we need to add \\nthe new component in the start of the rundown (to not disregard the property of the \\nstack). For this reason, allocate the location of the beginning component to the \\nlocation field of the new hub and make the new hub, the beginning hub of the \\nrundown.  \\nTime Complexity : \\no(1)\\n \\n\\n\\nPage 121:\\n \\n \\n \\nC implementation: \\nvoid push ()   \\n{   \\nintval;   \\nstruct node *ptr =(struct node*)malloc(sizeof(struct node));    \\nif(ptr == NULL)   \\n    {   \\nprintf(\"not able to push the element\");    \\n    }   \\nelse \\n    {   \\nprintf(\"Enter the value\");   \\nscanf(\"%d\",&val);   \\nif(head==NULL)   \\n        {          \\nptr->val = val;   \\nptr -> next = NULL;   \\nhead=ptr;   \\n        }    \\nelse \\n        {   \\nptr->val = val;   \\nptr->next = head;   \\nhead=ptr;   \\n \\n        }   \\nprintf(\"Item pushed\");   \\n \\n    }   \\n}   \\n\\n\\nPage 122:\\n \\n \\n \\n5.5.2. Deleting a hub from the stack (POP activity)  \\nErasing a hub from the highest point of stack is alluded to as pop activity. Erasing a \\nhub from the connected rundown usage of stack is not quite the same as that in the \\nexhibit execution. To pop a component from the stack, we need to follow the \\naccompanying advances : \\nCheck for the undercurrent condition: The sub-current condition happens when we \\nattempt to fly from a generally unfilled stack. The stack will be unfilled if the head \\npointer of the rundown focuses to invalid.  \\nChange the head pointer in like manner: In stack, the components are popped \\nuniquely from one end, thusly, the worth put away in the head pointer should be \\nerased and the hub should be liberated. The following hub of the head hub presently \\nturns into the head hub. \\nTime Complexity: o(n) \\n \\nC implementation \\nvoid pop()   \\n{   \\nint item;   \\nstruct node *ptr;   \\nif (head == NULL)   \\n    {   \\nprintf(\"Underflow\");   \\n    }   \\nelse \\n    {   \\nitem = head->val;   \\nptr = head;   \\nhead = head->next;   \\nfree(ptr);   \\nprintf(\"Item popped\");   \\n      }   \\n}   \\n \\n5.5.3.

At the end of the \\nday, it very well may be characterized as a rundown or an assortment with an \\nimperative that the addition can be performed toward one side called as the backside \\nor tail of the queue and cancellation is performed on another end called as the front \\nend or the top of the queue. \\n \\n6.4.Operations on Queue \\no \\nEnqueue: The enqueue activity is utilized to embed the component at the \\nbackside of the queue.  It brings void back.  \\no \\nDequeue: The dequeue activity plays out the erasure from the front-finish of \\nthe queue. It additionally restores the component which has been eliminated from the \\nfront-end. It restores a number worth. The dequeue activity can likewise be intended \\nto void.  \\no \\nPeek: This is the third activity that profits the component, which is pointed by \\nthe front pointer in the queue yet doesn\\'t erase it.  \\no \\nQueue flood (isfull): When the Queue is totally full, at that point it shows the \\nflood condition.  \\no \\nQueue undercurrent (isempty): When the Queue is unfilled, i.e., no \\ncomponents are in the Queue then it tosses the sub-current condition. \\nA Queue can be addressed as a compartment opened from both the sides in which the \\ncomponent can be enqueued from one side and dequeued from another side as \\ndemonstrated in the beneath figure: \\n6.5.Implementationof Queue \\nThere are two different ways of executing the Queue:  \\n6.5.1.Consecutive assignment: The successive distribution in a Queue can be \\nexecuted utilizing a cluster.  \\n6.5.2.Linked list allocation: The linked list portion in a Queue can be actualized \\nutilizing a linked list. \\n6.6.What are the utilization instances of Queue?  \\nHere, we will see this present reality situations where we can utilize the Queue \\ninformation structure. The Queue information structure is primarily utilized where \\n\\n\\nPage 129:\\n \\n \\nthere is a shared asset that needs to serve the different asks for however can serve a \\nsolitary solicitation at a time. In such cases, we need to utilize the Queue information \\nstructure for lining up the solicitations. The solicitation that shows up first in the line \\nwill be served first. Coming up next are this present reality situations in which the \\nQueue idea is utilized:  \\no \\nSuppose we have a printer divided among different machines in an \\norganization, and any machine or PC in an organization can send a print solicitation \\nto the printer. In any case, the printer can serve a solitary solicitation at a time, i.e., a \\nprinter can print a solitary archive at a time. At the point when any print demand \\ncomes from the organization, and if the printer is occupied, the printer\\'s program will \\nput the print demand in a line.  \\no \\nIf the solicitations are accessible in the Queue, the printer takes a solicitation \\nfrom the front of the Queue, and serves it.  \\no \\nThe processor in a PC is likewise utilized as a shared asset. There are \\nnumerous solicitations that the processor should execute, however the processor can \\nserve a solitary ask for or execute a solitary interaction at a time. Consequently, the \\ncycles are kept in a Queue for execution. \\n6.7.Types of Queue  \\nThere are four kinds of Queues:  \\n6.7.1.Linear Queue  \\nIn Linear Queue, an inclusion happens from one end while the erasure happens from \\nanother end. The end at which the addition happens is known as the backside, and the \\nend at which the erasure happens is known as front end. It carefully keeps the FIFO \\nrule. The straight Queue can be addressed, as demonstrated in the beneath figure: \\n \\nThe above figure shows that the components are embedded from the backside, and on \\nthe off chance that we embed more components in a Queue, at that point the back \\nworth gets increased on each addition. In the event that we need to show the \\ncancellation, at that point it tends to be addressed as: \\n \\nIn the above figure, we can see that the front pointer focuses to the following \\ncomponent, and the component which was recently pointed by the front pointer was \\nerased.  \\n\\n\\nPage 130:\\n \\n \\nThe significant disadvantage of utilizing a straight Queue is that inclusion is done \\ndistinctly from the backside. In the event that the initial three components are erased \\nfrom the Queue, we can\\'t embed more components despite the fact that the space is \\naccessible in a Linear Queue. For this  \\nsituation, the straight Queue shows the flood condition as the back is highlighting the \\nlast component of the Queue.  \\n6.7.2.Circular Queue  \\nIn Circular Queue, all the hubs are addressed as round. It is like the direct Queue \\naside from that the last component of the line is associated with the principal \\ncomponent. It is otherwise called Ring Buffer as all the finishes are associated with \\nanother end. The round line can be addressed as: \\n \\nThe disadvantage that happens in a direct line is overwhelmed by utilizing the \\nroundabout queue. On the off chance that the unfilled space is accessible in a round \\nline, the new component can be included a vacant space by just augmenting the \\nestimation of back.  \\n6.7.3.Priority Queue  \\nA need queue is another exceptional sort of Queue information structure in which \\nevery component has some need related with it. In view of the need of the \\ncomponent, the components are organized in a need line. In the event that the \\ncomponents happen with a similar need, at that point they are served by the FIFO \\nrule.  \\nIn need Queue, the inclusion happens dependent on the appearance while the \\ncancellation happens dependent on the need. The need Queue can be appeared as:  \\nThe above figure shows that the most elevated need component starts things out and \\nthe components of a similar need are organized dependent on FIFO structure. \\n\\n\\nPage 131:\\n \\n \\n6.7.4.Deque \\nBoth the Linear Queue and Deque are distinctive as the direct line follows the \\nFIFO standard while, deque doesn\\'t follow the FIFO rule. In Deque, the \\ninclusion and erasure can happen from the two closures. \\n \\n6.8.Array representation of Queue \\nWe can without much of a stretch address queue by utilizing direct exhibits. There \\nare two factors for example front and back, that are actualized on account of each \\nqueue. Front and back factors highlight the situation from where inclusions and \\ncancellations are acted in a queue. At first, the estimation of front and queue is - 1 \\nwhich addresses an unfilled queue. Cluster portrayal of a queue containing 5 \\ncomponents alongside the separate estimations of front and back, is appeared in the \\naccompanying figure. \\n \\n \\n6.9.Queue \\nThe above figure shows the queue of characters shaping the English word \"Hi\". \\nSince, No cancellation is acted in the line till now, thusly the estimation of front \\nremaining parts - 1 . Be that as it may, the estimation of back increments by one each \\ntime an addition is acted in the queue. Subsequent to embeddings a component into \\nthe queue appeared in the above figure, the queue will look something like after. The \\nestimation of back will become 5 while the estimation of front remaining parts same. \\n \\nQueue after inserting an element \\nAfter deleting an element, the value of front will increase from -1 to 0. however, the \\nqueue will look something like following. \\n\\n\\nPage 132:\\n \\n \\n \\nQueue after deleting an element \\nAlgorithm to embed any component in a line  \\nCheck if the line is as of now full by contrasting back with max - 1. assuming this is \\nthe case, at that point return a flood blunder.  \\nIn the event that the thing is to be embedded as the principal component in the \\nrundown, all things considered set the estimation of front and back to 0 and addition \\nthe component at the backside.  \\nIn any case continue to expand the estimation of back and addition every component \\nindividually having back as the file. \\n \\n6.9.1.Algorithm \\nStep 1: IF REAR = MAX - 1 \\nWrite OVERFLOW \\nGo to step \\n[END OF IF] \\nStep 2: IF FRONT = -1 and REAR = -1 \\nSET FRONT = REAR = 0 \\nELSE \\nSET REAR = REAR + 1 \\n[END OF IF] \\nStep 3: Set QUEUE[REAR] = NUM \\nStep 4: EXIT \\n \\n6.9.2.C Function \\nvoid insert (int queue[], int max, int front, int rear, int item)    \\n{   \\nif (rear + 1 == max)   \\n    {   \\nprintf(\"overflow\");

One of the option of cluster usage is connected rundown execution of \\nqueue.  \\nThe capacity prerequisite of connected portrayal of a queue with n components is \\no(n) while the time necessity for tasks is o(1).  \\nIn a linked queue, every hub of the queue comprises of two sections for example \\ninformation part and the connection part. Every component of the queue focuses to its \\nnearby next component in the memory.  \\nIn the linked queue, there are two pointers kept up in the memory for example front \\npointer and back pointer. The front pointer contains the location of the beginning \\ncomponent of the queue while the back pointer contains the location of the last \\ncomponent of the queue.  \\nInclusion and erasures are performed at back and front end separately. On the off \\nchance that front and back both are NULL, it shows that the line is vacant.  \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 139:\\n \\n \\nThe connected portrayal of queue is appeared in the accompanying figure. \\n \\n \\n6.11.Operation on Linked Queue \\nThere are two basic operations which can be implemented on the linked queues. The \\noperations are Insertion and Deletion. \\n6.11.1.Insert operation \\nThe addition activity attach the line by adding a component to the furthest limit of the \\nline. The new component will be the last component of the line.  \\nRight off the bat, assign the memory for the new hub ptr by utilizing the \\naccompanying assertion. \\nPtr = (struct node *) malloc (sizeof(struct node));   \\nThere can be the two situation of embeddings this new hub ptr into the connected \\nline. \\nIn the principal situation, we embed component into an unfilled queue. For this \\nsituation, the condition front = NULL turns out to be valid. Presently, the new \\ncomponent will be added as the lone component of the queue and the following \\npointer of front and back pointer both, will highlight NULL. \\nptr -> data = item;   \\nif(front == NULL)   \\n        {   \\nfront = ptr;   \\nrear = ptr;     \\nfront -> next = NULL;   \\nrear -> next = NULL;   \\n        }   \\nIn the subsequent case, the queue contains more than one component. The condition \\nfront = NULL turns out to be bogus. In this situation, we need to refresh the end \\npointer back with the goal that the following pointer of back will highlight the new \\nhub ptr. Since, this is a connected line, consequently we likewise need to make the \\nback pointer highlight the recently added hub ptr. We additionally need to make the \\nfollowing pointer of back highlight NULL. \\nrear -> next = ptr;   \\nrear = ptr;   \\nrear->next = NULL;   \\n\\n\\nPage 140:\\n \\n \\nIn this way, the element is inserted into the queue. The algorithm and the C \\nimplementation is given as follows. \\n6.11.2.Algorithm \\nStep 1: Allocate the space for the new node PTR \\nStep 2: SET PTR -> DATA = VAL \\nStep 3: IF FRONT = NULL \\nSET FRONT = REAR = PTR \\nSET FRONT -> NEXT = REAR -> NEXT = NULL \\nELSE \\nSET REAR -> NEXT = PTR \\nSET REAR = PTR \\nSET REAR -> NEXT = NULL \\n[END OF IF] \\nStep 4: END \\n \\n \\n \\n6.11.3.C Function \\nvoid insert(struct node *ptr, int item; )   \\n{   \\nptr = (struct node *) malloc (sizeof(struct node));   \\nif(ptr == NULL)   \\n    {   \\nprintf(\"\\\\nOVERFLOW\\\\n\");   \\nreturn;   \\n    }   \\nelse \\n    {    \\nptr -> data = item;   \\nif(front == NULL)   \\n        {   \\nfront = ptr;   \\nrear = ptr;    \\nfront -> next = NULL;   \\nrear -> next = NULL;   \\n        }   \\nelse \\n        {   \\nrear -> next = ptr;   \\nrear = ptr;   \\n\\n\\nPage 141:\\n \\n \\nrear->next = NULL;   \\n        }   \\n    }   \\n}      \\n6.12.Deletion \\nCancellation activity eliminates the component that is first embedded among all the \\nqueue components. Right off the bat, we need to check either the rundown is unfilled \\nor not. The condition front == NULL turns out to be valid if the rundown is unfilled, \\nfor this situation, we essentially compose undercurrent on the comfort and make exit.  \\nElse, we will erase the component that is pointed by the pointer front. For this reason, \\nduplicate the hub pointed by the front pointer into the pointer ptr. Presently, move the \\nfront pointer, highlight its next hub and free the hub pointed by the hub ptr. This is \\nfinished by utilizing the accompanying assertions. \\nptr = front;   \\nfront = front -> next;   \\nfree(ptr);   \\nThe algorithm and C function is given as follows. \\n \\n6.12.1.Algorithm \\nStep 1: IF FRONT = NULL \\nWrite \" Underflow \" \\nGo to Step 5 \\n[END OF IF] \\nStep 2: SET PTR = FRONT \\nStep 3: SET FRONT = FRONT -> NEXT \\nStep 4: FREE PTR \\nStep 5: END \\n6.12.2.C Function \\nvoid delete (struct node *ptr)   \\n{   \\nif(front == NULL)   \\n    {   \\nprintf(\"\\\\nUNDERFLOW\\\\n\");   \\nreturn;   \\n    }   \\nelse \\n    {   \\nptr = front;   \\nfront = front -> next;   \\nfree(ptr);   \\n\\n\\nPage 142:\\n \\n \\n    }   \\n}    \\n6.12.3.Menu-Driven Program implementing all the operations on Linked \\nQueue \\n#include<stdio.h> \\n#include<stdlib.h> \\nstruct node    \\n{   \\nint data;    \\nstruct node *next;   \\n};   \\nstruct node *front;   \\nstruct node *rear;    \\nvoid insert();   \\nvoid delete();   \\nvoid display();   \\nvoid main ()   \\n{   \\nint choice;    \\nwhile(choice != 4)    \\n    {      \\nprintf(\"\\\\n*************************Main \\nMenu*****************************\\\\n\");   \\nprintf(\"\\\\n===================================================\\n==============\\\\n\");   \\nprintf(\"\\\\n1.insert an element\\\\n2.Delete an element\\\\n3.Display the \\nqueue\\\\n4.Exit\\\\n\");   \\nprintf(\"\\\\nEnter your choice ?\");   \\nscanf(\"%d\",& choice);   \\nswitch(choice)   \\n        {   \\ncase 1:   \\ninsert();   \\nbreak;   \\ncase 2:   \\ndelete();   \\nbreak;   \\ncase 3:   \\ndisplay();   \\nbreak;   \\n\\n\\nPage 143:\\n \\n \\ncase 4:   \\nexit(0);   \\nbreak;   \\ndefault:    \\nprintf(\"\\\\nEnter valid choice??\\\\n\");   \\n        }   \\n    }   \\n}   \\nvoid insert()   \\n{   \\nstruct node *ptr;   \\nint item;    \\n \\nptr = (struct node *) malloc (sizeof(struct node));   \\nif(ptr == NULL)   \\n    {   \\nprintf(\"\\\\nOVERFLOW\\\\n\");   \\nreturn;   \\n    }   \\nelse \\n    {    \\nprintf(\"\\\\nEnter value?\\\\n\");   \\nscanf(\"%d\",&item);   \\nptr -> data = item;   \\nif(front == NULL)   \\n        {   \\nfront = ptr;   \\nrear = ptr;    \\nfront -> next = NULL;   \\nrear -> next = NULL;   \\n        }   \\nelse \\n        {   \\nrear -> next = ptr;   \\nrear = ptr;   \\nrear->next = NULL;   \\n        }   \\n    }   \\n}      \\nvoid delete ()   \\n\\n\\nPage 144:\\n \\n \\n{   \\nstruct node *ptr;   \\nif(front == NULL)   \\n    {   \\nprintf(\"\\\\nUNDERFLOW\\\\n\");   \\nreturn;   \\n    }   \\nelse \\n    {   \\nptr = front;   \\nfront = front -> next;   \\nfree(ptr);   \\n    }   \\n}   \\nvoid display()   \\n{   \\nstruct node *ptr;   \\nptr = front;       \\nif(front == NULL)   \\n    {   \\nprintf(\"\\\\nEmpty queue\\\\n\");   \\n    }   \\nelse \\n    {   printf(\"\\\\nprinting values .....\\\\n\");   \\nwhile(ptr != NULL)    \\n        {   \\nprintf(\"\\\\n%d\\\\n\",ptr -> data);   \\nptr = ptr -> next;   \\n        }   \\n    }   \\n}   \\nOutput: \\n \\n***********Main Menu********** \\n \\n============================== \\n \\n1.insert an element \\n2.Delete an element \\n3.Display the queue \\n\\n\\nPage 145:\\n \\n \\n4.Exit \\n \\nEnter your choice ?1 \\n \\nEnter value?

On the off chance that the back \\nspans to the end position of the Queue, at that point there may be plausibility that \\nsome empty spaces are left to start with which can\\'t be used. Thus, to defeat such \\nrestrictions, the idea of the round line was presented. \\n \\n \\n \\nAs we can find in the above picture, the back is at the last situation of the Queue and \\nfront is pointing some place as opposed to the 0th position. In the above exhibit, there \\nare just two components and other three positions are unfilled. The back is at the last \\nsituation of the Queue; in the event that we attempt to embed the component, at that \\npoint it will show that there are no unfilled spaces in the Queue. There is one answer \\nfor maintain a strategic distance from such wastage of memory space by moving both \\nthe components at the left and change the front and backside as needs be. It\\'s \\nanything but a for all intents and purposes great methodology since moving all the \\ncomponents will burn-through loads of time. The effective way to deal with stay \\naway from the wastage of the memory is to utilize circular queue data structure. \\n7.2.What is a Circular Queue?  \\nA circular queue is like a linear queueas it is likewise founded on the FIFO (First In \\nFirst Out) rule aside from that the last position is associated with the principal \\nposition in a round line that shapes a circle. It is otherwise called a Ring Buffer.  \\n7.2.1.Procedure on Circular Queue  \\nComing up next are the activities that can be performed on a circular queue:  \\nFront: It is utilized to get the front component from the Queue.  \\n\\n\\nPage 149:\\n \\n \\nBack: It is utilized to get the back component from the Queue.  \\nenQueue(value): This capacity is utilized to embed the new incentive in the Queue. \\nThe new component is constantly embedded from the backside.  \\ndeQueue(): This capacity erases a component from the Queue. The cancellation in a \\nQueue9- \\nconsistently happens from the front end. \\n \\n7.3.Uses of Circular Queue  \\nThe roundabout Queue can be utilized in the accompanying situations:  \\nMemory the board: The roundabout queue gives memory the executives. As we \\nhave just seen that in linear queue, the memory isn\\'t overseen proficiently. Yet, if \\nthere should arise an occurrence of a roundabout queue, the memory is overseen \\neffectively by putting the components in an area which is unused.  \\nCPU Scheduling: The working framework likewise utilizes the circular queue to \\nembed the cycles and afterward execute them.  \\nTraffic framework: In a PC control traffic framework, traffic signal is probably the \\nbest illustration of the circular queue. Each light of traffic signal gets ON individually \\nafter each jinterval of time. Like red light gets ON briefly then yellow light briefly \\nand afterward green light. After green light, the red light gets ON. \\n \\n7.4.Enqueue operation \\nThe steps of enqueue operation are given below: \\n \\nFirst, we will check whether the Queue is full or not. \\nInitially the front and rear are set to -1. When we insert the first element in a Queue, \\nfront and rear both are set to 0. \\nWhen we insert a new element, the rear gets incremented, i.e., rear=rear+1. \\nScenarios for inserting an element \\nThere are two scenarios in which queue is not full: \\nIf rear != max - 1, then rear will be incremented to mod(maxsize) and the new value \\nwill be inserted at the rear end of the queue. \\nIf front != 0 and rear = max - 1, it means that queue is not full, then set the value of \\nrear to 0 and insert the new element there. \\nThere are two cases in which the element cannot be inserted: \\nWhen front ==0 && rear = max-1, which means that front is at the first position of \\nthe Queue and rear is at the last position of the Queue. \\nfront== rear + 1; \\n7.5.Algorithm to insert an element in a circular queue \\nStep 1: IF (REAR+1)%MAX = FRONT \\nWrite \" OVERFLOW \" \\n\\n\\nPage 150:\\n \\n \\nGoto step 4 \\n[End OF IF] \\n \\nStep 2: IF FRONT = -1 and REAR = -1 \\nSET FRONT = REAR = 0 \\nELSE IF REAR = MAX - 1 and FRONT ! = 0 \\nSET REAR = 0 \\nELSE \\nSET REAR = (REAR + 1) % MAX \\n[END OF IF] \\n \\nStep 3: SET QUEUE[REAR] = VAL \\n \\nStep 4: EXIT \\n \\n7.6.Dequeue Operation \\nThe means of dequeue activity are given underneath:  \\nTo start with, we check if the Queue is vacant.

In the queue, the inclusion happens \\nfrom one end while the erasure happens from another end. The end at which the \\naddition happens is known as the backside while theend at which the erasure happens \\nis known as front end. \\n \\nDeque is a direct information structure in which the inclusion and cancellation tasks \\nare performed from the two finishes. We can say that deque is a summed up form of \\nthe line.  \\nHow about we take a gander at certain properties of deque.  \\nDeque can be utilized both as stack and line as it permits the inclusion and \\ncancellation procedure on the two finishes.  \\nIn deque, the inclusion and cancellation activity can be performed from one side. The \\nstack adheres to the LIFO rule in which both the addition and erasure can be \\nperformed distinctly from one end; in this way, we reason that deque can be \\nconsidered as a stack. \\n\\n\\nPage 159:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIn deque, the addition can be performed toward one side, and the erasure should be \\npossible on another end. The queue adheres to the FIFO rule in which the component \\nis embedded toward one side and erased from another end. Hence, we reason that the \\ndeque can likewise be considered as the queue. \\n \\nThere are two types of Queues, Input-restricted queue, and output-restricted queue. \\nInformation confined queue: The info limited queue implies that a few limitations are \\napplied to the inclusion. In info confined queue, the addition is applied to one end \\nwhile the erasure is applied from both the closures. \\n \\nYield confined queue: The yield limited line implies that a few limitations are applied \\nto the erasure activity. In a yield limited queue, the cancellation can be applied \\nuniquely from one end, while the inclusion is conceivable from the two finishes. \\n \\n7.10.Operations on Deque \\nThe following are the operations applied on deque: \\nInsert at front \\nDelete from end \\ninsert at rear \\ndelete from rear \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 160:\\n \\n \\nOther than inclusion and cancellation, we can likewise perform look activity in \\ndeque. Through look activity, we can get the front and the back component of the \\ndequeue.  \\nWe can perform two additional procedure on dequeue:  \\nisFull(): This capacity restores a genuine worth if the stack is full; else, it restores a \\nbogus worth.  \\nisEmpty(): This capacity restores a genuine worth if the stack is vacant; else it \\nrestores a bogus worth.  \\n7.10.1.Memory Representation  \\nThe deque can be executed utilizing two information structures, i.e., round exhibit, \\nand doubly connected rundown. To actualize the deque utilizing round exhibit, we \\ninitially should realize what is roundabout cluster. \\n \\n7.10.2.What is a circular array? \\nAn exhibit is supposed to be roundabout if the last component of the cluster is \\nassociated with the primary component of the exhibit. Assume the size of the cluster \\nis 4, and the exhibit is full however the primary area of the cluster is unfilled. In the \\nevent that we need to embed the exhibit component, it won\\'t show any flood \\ncondition as the last component is associated with the primary component. The worth \\nwhich we need to embed will be included the primary area of the exhibit. \\n \\n7.10.3.Applications of Deque \\n\\uf0b7 The deque can be utilized as a stack and line; subsequently, it can perform \\nboth re-try and fix activities.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 It tends to be utilized as a palindrome checker implies that in the event that we \\nread the string from the two closures, at that point the string would be the \\nequivalent.  \\n\\n\\nPage 161:\\n \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 It tends to be utilized for multiprocessor planning. Assume we have two \\nprocessors, and every processor has one interaction to execute. Every \\nprocessor is appointed with an interaction or a task, and each cycle contains \\nnumerous strings. Every processor keeps a deque that contains strings that are \\nprepared to execute. The processor executes an interaction, and on the off \\nchance that a cycle makes a kid cycle, at that point that cycle will be \\nembedded at the front of the deque of the parent interaction. Assume the \\nprocessor P2 has finished the execution of every one of its strings then it takes \\nthe string from the backside of the processor P1 and adds to the front finish of \\nthe processor P2. The processor P2 will take the string from the front end; \\nthusly, the erasure takes from both the closures, i.e., front and backside. This \\nis known as the A-take calculation for planning. \\n \\n7.11.Implementation of Deque using a circular array \\nThe following are the steps to perform the operations on the Deque: \\nEnqueue operation \\n1. At first, we are thinking about that the deque is unfilled, so both front and \\nback are set to - 1, i.e., f = - 1 and r = - 1.  \\n \\n2. As the deque is vacant, so embeddings a component either from the front or \\nbackside would be something very similar. Assume we have embedded \\ncomponent 1, at that point front is equivalent to 0, and the back is likewise \\nequivalent to 0. \\n \\n \\n3. Assume we need to embed the following component from the back. To embed \\nthe component from the backside, we first need to augment the back, i.e., \\nrear=rear+1. Presently, the back is highlighting the subsequent component, \\nand the front is highlighting the main component. \\n\\n\\nPage 162:\\n \\n \\n \\n4. Assume we are again embeddings the component from the backside. To \\nembed the component, we will first addition the back, and now back focuses \\nto the third component. \\n \\n5. In the event that we need to embed the component from the front end, and \\naddition a component from the front, we need to decrement the estimation of \\nfront by 1. In the event that we decrement the front by 1, at that point the front \\nfocuses to - 1 area, which isn\\'t any substantial area in an exhibit. Thus, we set \\nthe front as (n - 1), which is equivalent to 4 as n is 5. When the front is set, we \\nwill embed the incentive as demonstrated in the beneath figure: \\n \\n7.12.Dequeue Operation \\n1. On the off chance that the front is highlighting the last component of the \\nexhibit, and we need to play out the erase activity from the front. To erase any \\ncomponent from the front, we need to set front=front+1. At present, the \\nestimation of the front is equivalent to 4, and in the event that we increase the \\nestimation of front, it becomes 5 which is definitely not a substantial list. \\nThusly, we presume that in the event that front focuses to the last component, \\nat that point front is set to 0 if there should be an occurrence of erase activity. \\n\\n\\nPage 163:\\n \\n \\n \\n2. If we want to delete the element from rear end then we need to decrement the \\nrear value by 1, i.e., rear=rear-1 as shown in the below figure: \\n \\n3. In the event that the back is highlighting the principal component, and we \\nneed to erase the component from the backside then we need to set rear=n-1 \\nwhere n is the size of the exhibit as demonstrated in the beneath figure: \\n\\n\\nPage 164:\\n \\n \\n \\nLet\\'s create a program of deque. \\nThe following are the six functions that we have used in the below program: \\no enqueue_front(): It is used to insert the element from the front end. \\no enqueue_rear(): It is used to insert the element from the rear end. \\no dequeue_front(): It is used to delete the element from the front end. \\no dequeue_rear(): It is used to delete the element from the rear end. \\no getfront(): It is used to return the front element of the deque. \\no getrear(): It is used to return the rear element of the deque. \\n7.13.Program for dqeue Implementation   \\n#define size 5     \\n#include <stdio.h>   \\nint deque[size];

The need of the \\ncomponents in a need queue will decide the request where components are taken out \\nfrom the need line.  \\nThe need queue underpins just similar components, which implies that the \\ncomponents are either masterminded in a rising or slipping request.  \\nFor instance, assume we have a few qualities like 1, 3, 4, 8, 14, 22 embedded in a \\nneed queue with a requesting forced on the qualities is from least to the best. Along \\nthese lines, the 1 number would have the most elevated need while 22 will have the \\nleast need. \\n \\n7.15.Characteristics of a Priority queue \\nA need queue is an expansion of a line that contains the accompanying qualities:  \\no \\nEvery component in a need line has some need related with it.  \\no \\nAn component with the higher need will be erased before the cancellation of \\nthe lesser need.  \\no \\nIf two components in a need queue have a similar need, they will be organized \\nutilizing the FIFO rule. \\nLet\\'s understand the priority queue through an example. \\nWe have a priority queue that contains the following values: \\n1, 3, 4, 8, 14, 22 \\n\\n\\nPage 170:\\n \\n \\nAll the qualities are orchestrated in climbing request. Presently, we will see how the \\nneed line will take care of playing out the accompanying activities:  \\n \\npoll(): This capacity will eliminate the most elevated need component from the need \\nline. In the above need line, the \\'1\\' component has the most elevated need, so it will \\nbe eliminated from the need line.  \\nadd(2): This capacity will embed \\'2\\' component in a need line. As 2 is the littlest \\ncomponent among all the numbers so it will acquire the most elevated need.  \\npoll() It will eliminate \\'2\\' component from the need line as it has the most elevated \\nneed line.  \\nadd(5): It will embed 5 component after 4 as 5 is bigger than 4 and lesser than 8, so it \\nwill acquire the third most noteworthy need in a need line. \\n \\n \\n7.16.Types of Priority Queue \\nThere are two types of priority queue: \\n7.16.1.Ascending order priority queue: In rising request need line, a lower need \\nnumber is given as a higher need in a need. For instance, we take the numbers from 1 \\nto 5 orchestrated in a rising request like 1,2,3,4,5; in this manner, the most modest \\nnumber, i.e., 1 is given as the most noteworthy need in a need line. \\n \\n \\n \\n7.16.2.Descending order priority queue: \\nIn plunging request need line, a higher need number is given as a higher need in a \\nneed. For instance, we take the numbers from 1 to 5 orchestrated in diving request \\nlike 5, 4, 3, 2, 1; along these lines, the biggest number, i.e., 5 is given as the most \\nelevated need in a need line. \\n\\n\\nPage 171:\\n \\n \\n \\n7.16.3.Representation of priority queue \\nPresently, we will perceive how to address the need line through a single direction \\nlist.  \\nWe will make the need line by utilizing the rundown given underneath in which \\nINFO list contains the information components, PRN list contains the need quantities \\nof every information component accessible in the INFO rundown, and LINK \\nessentially contains the location of the following hub. \\n \\nLet\\'s create the priority queue step by step. \\nIn the case of priority queue, lower priority number is considered the higher priority, \\ni.e., lower priority number = higher priority. \\nStep 1: In the list, lower priority number is 1, whose data value is 333, so it will be \\ninserted in the list as shown in the below diagram: \\nStep 2: After inserting 333, priority number 2 is having a higher priority, and data \\nvalues associated with this priority are 222 and 111. So, this data will be inserted \\nbased on the FIFO principle; therefore 222 will be added first and then 111. \\nStep 3: After inserting the elements of priority 2, the next higher priority number is 4 \\nand data elements associated with 4 priority numbers are 444, 555, 777. In this case, \\nelements would be inserted based on the FIFO principle; therefore, 444 will be added \\nfirst, then 555, and then 777. \\nStep 4: After inserting the elements of priority 4, the next higher priority number is 5, \\nand the value associated with priority 5 is 666, so it will be inserted at the end of the \\nqueue. \\n\\n\\nPage 172:\\n \\n \\n \\n7.17.Implementation of Priority Queue: \\nThe need queue can be actualized in four different ways that incorporate clusters, \\nconnected rundown, stack information construction and twofold pursuit tree. The \\nload information structure is the most productive method of executing the need \\nqueue, so we will actualize the need queue utilizing a store information structure in \\nthis subject. Presently, first we comprehend the motivation behind why pile is the \\nmost productive route among the wide range of various information structures. \\n7.17.1.Analysis of complexities using different implementations \\n \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 173:\\n \\n \\nUnit 4 : Chapter 8 \\nLinked List \\n8.0 Objective \\n8.1.What is Linked List? \\n8.2.How can we declare the Linked list? \\n8.3.Advantages of using a Linked list over Array \\n8.4.Applications of Linked List \\n8.5.Types of Linked List \\n \\n8.5.1.Singly Linked list \\n \\n8.5.2.Doubly linked list \\n \\n8.5.3.Circular linked list \\n \\n8.5.4.Doubly Circular linked list \\n8.6.Linked List \\n8.7.Uses of Linked List \\n8.8.Why use linked list over array? \\n \\n8.8.1.Singly linked list or One way chain \\n \\n8.8.2.Operations on Singly Linked List \\n \\n8.8.3.Linked List in C: Menu Driven Program \\n8.9.Doubly linked list \\n \\n8.9.1.Memory Representation of a doubly linked list \\n \\n8.9.2.Operations on doubly linked list \\n \\n8.9.3.Menu Driven Program in C to implement all the operations of \\ndoubly linked list \\n \\n8.0.Objective \\nThis chapter would make you understand the following concepts: \\n\\uf0b7 To understand the concept of Linked List \\n\\uf0b7 To understand Types of Linked List \\n\\uf0b7 To Singly Linked list \\n\\uf0b7 To Doubly Linked list \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 174:\\n \\n \\n8.1.What is Linked List? \\nA linked list is also a collection of elements, but the elements are not stored in a \\nconsecutive location.Suppose a programmer made a request for storing the integer \\nvalue then size of 4-byte memory block is assigned to the integer value. The \\nprogrammer made another request for storing 3 more integer elements; then, three \\ndifferent memory blocks are assigned to these three elements but the memory blocks \\nare available in a random location. So, how are the elements connected?. \\nThese elements are linked to each other by providing one additional information \\nalong with an element, i.e., the address of the next element. The variable that stores \\nthe address of the next element is known as a pointer. Therefore, we conclude that the \\nlinked list contains two parts, i.e., the first one is the data element, and the other is the \\npointer. The pointer variable will occupy 4 bytes which is pointing to the next \\nelement. \\nA linked list can also be defined as the collection of the nodes in which one node is \\nconnected to another node, and node consists of two parts, i.e., one is the data part \\nand the second one is the address part, as shown in the below figure: \\n \\nIn the above figure, we can observe that each node contains the data and the address \\nof the next node. The last node of the linked list contains the NULL value in the \\naddress part. \\n8.2.How can we declare the Linked list? \\nThe need line can be actualized in four different ways that incorporate clusters, \\nconnected rundown, stack information construction and twofold pursuit tree. The \\nload information structure is the most productive method of executing the need line, \\nso we will actualize the need line utilizing a store information structure in this \\n\\n\\nPage 175:\\n \\n \\nsubject. Presently, first we comprehend the motivation behind why pile is the most \\nproductive route among the wide range of various information structures. \\nThe structure of a linked list can be defined as: \\nstruct node   \\n{   \\nint data;   \\nstruct node *next;   \\n} \\nIn the above declaration, we have defined a structure named as a node consisting of \\ntwo variables: an integer variable (data), and the other one is the pointer (next), which \\ncontains the address of the next node. \\n \\n8.3.Advantages of using a Linked list over Array \\nThe following are the advantages of using a linked list over an array: \\nDynamic data structure: \\nThe size of the linked list is not fixed as it can vary according to our requirements. \\nInsertion and Deletion: \\nInsertion and deletion in linked list are easier than array as the elements in an array \\nare stored in a consecutive location. In contrast, in the case of a linked list, the \\nelements are stored in a random location. The complexity for insertion and deletion \\nof elements from the beginning is O(1) in the linked list, while in the case of an array, \\nthe complexity would be O(n). If we want to insert or delete the element in an array, \\nthen we need to shift the elements for creating the space. On the other hand, in the \\nlinked list, we do not have to shift the elements. In the linked list, we just need to \\nupdate the address of the pointer in the node. \\nMemory efficient \\nIts memory consumption is efficient as the size of the linked list can grow or shrink \\naccording to our requirements. \\nImplementation \\nBoth the stacks and queues can be implemented using a linked list. \\nDisadvantages of Linked list \\n\\n\\nPage 176:\\n \\n \\nThe following are the disadvantages of linked list: \\nMemory usage \\nThe node in a linked list occupies more memory than array as each node occupies \\ntwo types of variables, i.e., one is a simple variable, and another is a pointer variable \\nthat occupies 4 bytes in the memory. \\nTraversal \\nIn a linked list, the traversal is not easy. If we want to access the element in a linked \\nlist, we cannot access the element randomly, but in the case of an array, we can \\nrandomly access the element by index. For example, if we want to access the 3rd \\nnode, then we need to traverse all the nodes before it. So, the time required to access \\na particular node is large. \\nReverse traversing \\nIn a linked list, backtracking or reverse traversing is difficult. In a doubly linked list, \\nit is easier but requires more memory to store the back pointer. \\n \\n8.4.Applications of Linked List \\nThe applications of the linked list are given below: \\no With the assistance of a connected rundown, the polynomials can be \\naddressed just as we can play out the procedure on the polynomial. We realize \\nthat polynomial is an assortment of terms where each term contains \\ncoefficient and force. The coefficients and force of each term are put away as \\nhub and connection pointer focuses to the following component in a \\nconnected rundown, so connected rundown can be utilized to make, erase and \\nshow the polynomial. \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 177:\\n \\n \\no An inadequate grid is utilized in logical calculation and mathematical \\ninvestigation. In this way, a connected rundown is utilized to address the \\nscanty grid.  \\no The different tasks like understudy\\'s subtleties, worker\\'s subtleties or item \\nsubtleties can be executed utilizing the connected rundown as the connected \\nrundown utilizes the design information type that can hold distinctive \\ninformation types.  \\no Stack, Queue, tree and different other information constructions can be \\nexecuted utilizing a connected rundown.  \\no The chart is an assortment of edges and vertices, and the diagram can be \\naddressed as a nearness lattice and contiguousness list. In the event that we \\nneed to address the diagram as a nearness network, at that point it very well \\nmay be actualized as an exhibit. In the event that we need to address the \\ndiagram as a nearness list, at that point it tends to be actualized as a connected \\nrundown.  \\no To actualize hashing, we require hash tables. The hash table contains sections \\nthat are executed utilizing connected rundown.  \\no A connected rundown can be utilized to execute dynamic memory \\ndesignation. The powerful memory distribution is the memory designation \\ndone at the run-time. \\n8.5.Types of Linked List \\nBefore knowing about the types of a linked list, we should know what is linked list. \\nSo, to know about the linked list, click on the link given below: \\nTypes of Linked list \\nThe following are the types of linked list: \\nSingly Linked list \\nDoubly Linked list \\nCircular Linked list \\nDoubly Circular Linked list \\n \\n8.5.1.Singly Linked list \\n\\n\\nPage 178:\\n \\n \\nIt is the normally utilized connected rundown in projects. In the event that we are \\ndiscussing the connected show, it implies it is a separately connected rundown. The \\nseparately connected rundown is an information structure that contains two sections, \\ni.e., one is the information part, and the other one is the location part, which contains \\nthe location of the following or the replacement hub. The location part in a hub is \\notherwise called a pointer.  \\nAssume we have three hubs, and the locations of these three hubs are 100, 200 and \\n300 separately. The portrayal of three hubs as a connected rundown is appeared in the \\nunderneath figure: \\n \\nWe can see in the above figure that there are three unique hubs having address 100, \\n200 and 300 individually. The principal hub contains the location of the following \\nhub, i.e., 200, the subsequent hub contains the location of the last hub, i.e., 300, and \\nthe third hub contains the NULL incentive in its location part as it doesn\\'t highlight \\nany hub. The pointer that holds the location of the underlying hub is known as a head \\npointer.  \\n \\nThe connected rundown, which is appeared in the above outline, is referred to as an \\nindependently connected rundown as it contains just a solitary connection. In this \\nrundown, just forward crossing is conceivable; we can\\'t navigate the regressive way \\nas it has just one connection in the rundown. \\nRepresentation of the node in a singly linked list \\nstruct node   \\n{   \\nint data;   \\n\\n\\nPage 179:\\n \\n \\nstruct node *next;   \\n}   \\n \\n8.5.2.Doubly linked list \\nAs the name recommends, the doubly connected rundown contains two pointers. We \\ncan characterize the doubly connected rundown as a straight information structure \\nwith three sections: the information part and the other two location part. All in all, a \\ndoubly connected rundown is a rundown that has three sections in a solitary hub, \\nincorporates one information section, a pointer to its past hub, and a pointer to the \\nfollowing hub.  \\nAssume we have three hubs, and the location of these hubs are 100, 200 and 300, \\nseparately. The portrayal of these hubs in a doubly-connected rundown is appeared \\nbeneath: \\n \\nAs we can see in the above figure, the hub in a doubly-connected rundown has two \\nlocation parts; one section stores the location of the following while the other piece of \\nthe hub stores the past hub\\'s location. The underlying hub in the doubly connected \\nrundown has the NULL incentive in the location part, which gives the location of the \\npast hub. \\nRepresentation of the node in a doubly linked list \\nstruct node   \\n{   \\nint data;   \\nstruct node *next;   \\nstruct node *prev;    \\n}    \\n\\n\\nPage 180:\\n \\n \\nIn the above portrayal, we have characterized a client characterized structure named a \\nhub with three individuals, one is information of number sort, and the other two are \\nthe pointers, i.e., next and prev of the hub type. The following pointer variable holds \\nthe location of the following hub, and the prev pointer holds the location of the past \\nhub. The sort of both the pointers, i.e., next and prev is struct hub as both the pointers \\nare putting away the location of the hub of the struct hub type. \\n8.5.3.Circular linked list \\nA round connected rundown is a variety of an independently connected rundown. The \\nlone contrast between the separately connected rundown and a round connected \\nrundown is that the last hub doesn\\'t highlight any hub in an independently connected \\nrundown, so its connection part contains a NULL worth. Then again, the roundabout \\nconnected rundown is a rundown where the last hub interfaces with the principal hub, \\nso the connection a piece of the last hub holds the main hub\\'s location. The round \\nconnected rundown has no beginning and finishing hub. We can navigate toward any \\npath, i.e., either in reverse or forward. The diagrammatic portrayal of the round \\nconnected rundown is appeared underneath: \\nstruct node   \\n{   \\nint data;   \\nstruct node *next;   \\n}   \\nA circular linked list is a sequence of elements in which each node has a link to the \\nnext node, and the last node is having a link to the first node. The representation of \\nthe circular linked list will be similar to the singly linked list, as shown below: \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 181:\\n \\n \\n8.5.4.Doubly Circular linked list \\nThe doubly circular linked list has the features of both the circular linked list and \\ndoubly linked list. \\n \\nThe above figure shows the portrayal of the doubly round connected rundown \\nwherein the last hub is appended to the principal hub and consequently makes a \\ncircle. It is a doubly connected rundown likewise in light of the fact that every hub \\nholds the location of the past hub too. The primary distinction between the doubly \\nconnected rundown and doubly roundabout connected rundown is that the doubly \\nroundabout connected rundown doesn\\'t contain the NULL incentive in the past field \\nof the hub. As the doubly roundabout connected contains three sections, i.e., two \\nlocation parts and one information part so its portrayal is like the doubly connected \\nrundown. \\nstruct node   \\n{   \\nint data;   \\nstruct node *next;   \\nstruct node *prev;    \\n}   \\n \\n8.6.Linked List \\n\\uf0b7 Linked List can be defined as collection of objects called nodes that are randomly \\nstored in the memory. \\n\\uf0b7 A node contains two fields i.e. data stored at that particular address and the pointer \\nwhich contains the address of the next node in the memory. \\n\\n\\nPage 182:\\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The last node of the list contains pointer to the null. \\n \\n8.7.Uses of Linked List \\n\\uf0b7 The rundown isn\\'t needed to be adjoiningly present in the memory. The hub \\ncan dwell anyplace in the memory and connected together to make a \\nrundown. This accomplishes advanced usage of room.  \\n\\uf0b7 list size is restricted to the memory size and shouldn\\'t be announced ahead of \\ntime.  \\n\\uf0b7 Void hub can not be available in the connected rundown.  \\n\\uf0b7 We can store estimations of crude sorts or items in the separately connected \\nrundown. \\n8.8.Why use linked list over array? \\nTill now, we were utilizing cluster information construction to sort out the gathering \\nof components that are to be put away separately in the memory. Nonetheless, Array \\nhas a few points of interest and hindrances which should be known to choose the \\ninformation structure which will be utilized all through the program. \\nArray contains following limitations: \\n\\uf0b7 The size of cluster should be known ahead of time prior to utilizing it in the \\nprogram.  \\n\\uf0b7 Expanding size of the cluster is a period taking cycle. It is practically difficult \\nto grow the size of the exhibit at run time.  \\n\\uf0b7 All the components in the cluster require to be adorningly put away in the \\nmemory. Embedding’s any component in the cluster needs moving of every \\none of its archetypes. \\n\\n\\nPage 183:\\n \\n \\nLinked list is the data structure which can overcome all the limitations of an array. \\nUsing linked list is useful because \\n\\uf0b7 It dispenses the memory progressively. All the hubs of connected rundown \\nare non-adjacently put away in the memory and connected along with the \\nassistance of pointers.  \\n\\uf0b7 Measuring is not, at this point an issue since we don\\'t have to characterize its \\nsize at the hour of affirmation. Rundown develops according to the program\\'s \\ninterest and restricted to the accessible memory space. \\n8.8.1.Singly linked list or One way chain \\nSeparately connected rundown can be characterized as the assortment of requested \\narrangement of components. The quantity of components may shift as indicated by \\nneed of the program. A hub in the independently connected rundown comprise of two \\nsections: information part and connection part. Information some portion of the hub \\nstores real data that will be addressed by the hub while the connection a piece of the \\nhub stores the location of its nearby replacement.  \\nOne way chain or separately connected rundown can be crossed distinctly one way. \\nAs such, we can say that every hub contains just next pointer, hence we can not cross \\nthe rundown the opposite way.  \\nConsider a model where the imprints acquired by the understudy in three subjects are \\nput away in a connected rundown as demonstrated in the figure. \\n \\n \\nIn the above figure, the bolt addresses the connections. The information a piece of \\neach hub contains the imprints acquired by the understudy in the diverse subject. The \\nlast hub in the rundown is recognized by the invalid pointer which is available in the \\nlocation part of the last hub. We can have as numerous components we need, in the \\ninformation part of the rundown. \\n\\n\\nPage 184:\\n \\n \\nComplexity \\n \\n8.8.2.Operations on Singly Linked List \\nThere are various operations which can be performed on singly linked list. A list of \\nall such operations is given below. \\nNode Creation \\nstruct node    \\n{   \\nint data;    \\nstruct node *next;   \\n};   \\nstruct node *head, *ptr;    \\nptr = (struct node *)malloc(sizeof(struct node *)); \\n \\nInsertion \\nThe insertion into a singly linked list can be performed at different positions. Based \\non the position of the new node being inserted, the insertion is categorized into the \\nfollowing categories. \\nSN \\nOperation \\nDescription \\n1 \\nInsertion at \\nbeginning \\nIt involves inserting any element at the front of the list. We just need \\nto a few link adjustments to make the new node as the head of the \\nlist. \\n\\n\\nPage 185:\\n \\n \\n2 \\nInsertion at end \\nof the list \\nIt involves insertion at the last of the linked list. The new node can \\nbe inserted as the only node in the list or it can be inserted as the last \\none. Different logics are implemented in each scenario. \\n3 \\nInsertion after \\nspecified node \\nIt involves insertion after the specified node of the linked list. We \\nneed to skip the desired number of nodes in order to reach the node \\nafter which the new node will be inserted. . \\n \\nDeletion and Traversing \\nThe Deletion of a node from a singly linked list can be performed at different \\npositions. Based on the position of the node being deleted, the operation is \\ncategorized into the following categories. \\nSN \\nOperation \\nDescription \\n1 \\nDeletion at \\nbeginning \\nIt involves deletion of a node from the beginning of the list. This \\nis the simplest operation among all. It just need a few \\nadjustments in the node pointers. \\n2 \\nDeletion at the \\nend of the list \\nIt involves deleting the last node of the list. The list can either be \\nempty or full. Different logic is implemented for the different \\nscenarios. \\n3 \\nDeletion after \\nspecified node \\nIt involves deleting the node after the specified node in the list. \\nwe need to skip the desired number of nodes to reach the node \\nafter which the node will be deleted. This requires traversing \\nthrough the list. \\n4 \\nTraversing \\nIn traversing, we simply visit each node of the list at least once in \\norder to perform some specific operation on it, for example, \\nprinting data part of each node present in the list. \\n\\n\\nPage 186:\\n \\n \\n5 \\nSearching \\nIn searching, we match each element of the list with the given \\nelement. If the element is found on any of the location then \\nlocation of that element is returned otherwise null is returned. . \\n \\n8.8.3.Linked List in C: Menu Driven Program \\n#include<stdio.h>

just as the following hub in the arrangement. \\nSubsequently, in a doubly connected rundown, a hub comprises of three sections: hub \\ninformation, pointer to the following hub in arrangement (next pointer) , pointer to \\nthe past hub (past pointer). An example hub in a doubly connected rundown is \\nappeared in the figure. \\n \\nA doubly linked list containing three nodes having numbers from 1 to 3 in their data \\npart, is shown in the following image. \\n\\n\\nPage 203:\\n \\n \\n \\nIn C, structure of a node in doubly linked list can be given as : \\nstruct node    \\n{   \\nstruct node *prev;    \\nint data;   \\nstruct node *next;    \\n}   \\nThe prev part of the first node and the next part of the last node will always contain \\nnull indicating end in each direction. \\nDoubly connected rundown is a mind boggling kind of connected rundown wherein a \\nhub contains a pointer to the past just as the following hub in the arrangement. \\nSubsequently, in a doubly connected rundown, a hub comprises of three sections: hub \\ninformation, pointer to the following hub in arrangement (next pointer) , pointer to \\nthe past hub (past pointer). An example hub in a doubly connected rundown is \\nappeared in the figure. \\n \\n8.9.1.Memory Representation of a doubly linked list \\nMemory Representation of a doubly connected rundown is appeared in the \\naccompanying picture. For the most part, doubly connected rundown burns-through \\nmore space for each hub and in this way, causes more sweeping fundamental \\nactivities, for example, inclusion and erasure. Notwithstanding, we can without much \\nof a stretch control the components of the rundown since the rundown keeps up \\npointers in both the ways (forward and in reverse).  \\n\\n\\nPage 204:\\n \\n \\nIn the accompanying picture, the principal component of the rundown that is for \\nexample 13 put away at address 1. The head pointer focuses to the beginning location \\n1. Since this is the primary component being added to the rundown along these lines \\nthe prev of the rundown contains invalid. The following hub of the rundown lives at \\naddress 4 accordingly the first hub contains 4 in quite a while next pointer.  \\nWe can cross the rundown in this manner until we discover any hub containing \\ninvalid or - 1 in its next part. \\n \\n \\n8.9.2.Operations on doubly linked list \\nNode Creation \\nstruct node    \\n{   \\nstruct node *prev;   \\nint data;   \\nstruct node *next;

a roundabout Singly connected rundown, the last hub of the rundown contains a \\npointer to the primary hub of the rundown. We can have roundabout separately \\nconnected rundown just as roundabout doubly connected rundown.  \\nWe navigate a roundabout separately connected rundown until we arrive at a similar \\nhub where we began. The roundabout separately loved rundown has no start and no \\nconsummation. There is no invalid worth present in the following piece of any of the \\nhubs.  \\nThe accompanying picture shows a round separately connected rundown. \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 225:\\n \\n \\nCircular linked list are generally utilized in errand support in working frameworks. \\nThere are numerous models where round connected rundown are being utilized in \\nsoftware engineering including program riding where a record of pages visited in the \\npast by the client, is kept up as roundabout connected records and can be gotten to \\nagain on tapping the past catch. \\n9.2.Memory Representation of circular linked list: \\nIn the accompanying picture, memory portrayal of a round connected rundown \\ncontaining signs of an understudy in 4 subjects. Nonetheless, the picture shows a \\nbrief look at how the round rundown is being put away in the memory. The beginning \\nor top of the rundown is highlighting the component with the file 1 and containing 13 \\nimprints in the information part and 4 in the following part. Which implies that it is \\nconnected with the hub that is being put away at fourth list of the rundown.  \\nNotwithstanding, because of the way that we are thinking about roundabout \\nconnected rundown in the memory in this manner the last hub of the rundown \\ncontains the location of the primary hub of the rundown. \\n \\n \\nWe can likewise have more than one number of connected rundown in the memory \\nwith the distinctive beginning pointers highlighting the diverse beginning hubs in the \\nrundown. The last hub is distinguished by its next part which contains the location of \\n\\n\\nPage 226:\\n \\n \\nthe beginning hub of the rundown. We should have the option to recognize the last \\nhub of any connected rundown with the goal that we can discover the quantity of \\ncycles which should be performed while navigating the rundown. \\n9.3.Operations on Circular Singly linked list: \\nInsertion \\nSN Operation \\nDescription \\n1 Insertion at beginning Adding a node into circular singly linked list at the beginning. \\n2 Insertion at the end \\nAdding a node into circular singly linked list at the end. \\n9.4.Deletion& Traversing \\nSN \\nOperation \\nDescription \\n1 Deletion at \\nbeginning \\nRemoving the node from circular singly linked list at the beginning. \\n2 Deletion at the \\nend \\nRemoving the node from circular singly linked list at the end. \\n3 Searching \\nCompare each element of the node with the given item and return the \\nlocation at which the item is present in the list otherwise return null. \\n4 Traversing \\nVisiting each element of the list at least once in order to perform some \\nspecific operation. \\n \\n9.5.Menu-driven program in C implementing all operations on circular singly \\nlinked list \\n#include<stdio.h> \\n#include<stdlib.h> \\nstruct node    \\n{   \\nint data;

The last \\nhub of the rundown contains the location of the main hub of the rundown. The main \\nhub of the rundown additionally contain address of the last hub in its past pointer. \\nA circular doubly linked list is shown in the following figure. \\n\\n\\nPage 238:\\n \\n \\n \\nBecause of the way that a round doubly connected rundown contains three sections in \\nits design hence, it requests more space per hub and more costly essential activities. \\nBe that as it may, a round doubly connected rundown gives simple control of the \\npointers and the looking turns out to be twice as proficient. \\n9.7.Memory Management of Circular Doubly linked list \\nThe accompanying figure shows the manner by which the memory is designated for a \\nround doubly connected rundown. The variable head contains the location of the \\nprincipal component of the rundown for example 1 consequently the beginning hub \\nof the rundown contains information An is put away at address 1. Since, every hub of \\nthe rundown should have three sections along these lines, the beginning hub of the \\nrundown contains address of the last hub for example 8 and the following hub for \\nexample 4. The last hub of the rundown that is put away at address 8 and containing \\ninformation as 6, contains address of the primary hub of the rundown as \\ndemonstrated in the picture for example 1. In roundabout doubly connected rundown, \\nthe last hub is recognized by the location of the main hub which is put away in the \\nfollowing piece of the last hub hence the hub which contains the location of the \\nprincipal hub, is really the last hub of the rundown. \\n\\n\\nPage 239:\\n \\n \\n \\n9.8.Operations on circular doubly linked list : \\nThere are different tasks which can be performed on round doubly connected \\nrundown. The hub design of a roundabout doubly connected rundown is like doubly \\nconnected rundown. Be that as it may, the procedure on round doubly connected \\nrundown is portrayed in the accompanying table. \\nSN Operation \\nDescription \\n1 Insertion at beginning Adding a node in circular doubly linked list at the beginning. \\n2 Insertion at end \\nAdding a node in circular doubly linked list at the end. \\n3 Deletion at beginning Removing a node in circular doubly linked list from beginning. \\n4 Deletion at end \\nRemoving a node in circular doubly linked list at the end. \\n \\nTraversing and searching in circular doubly linked list is similar to that in the circular \\nsingly linked list. \\n9.9.C program to implement all the operations on circular doubly linked list \\n#include<stdio.h> \\n#include<stdlib.h> \\nstruct node   \\n{   \\nstruct node *prev;

That is why it is called as AVL Tree. \\nAVL tree is a solution of a binary search tree which is constructed for either all the \\nvalues of increasing order or decreasing order. It has following problems: \\n1. When a binary search tree is constructed of ascending or descending values it \\nwill go one side either left hand side or right hand side. \\n2. The tree will not look like a tree at the same time and it will not be balanced. \\n \\nTherefore AVL Tree is a solution to overcome from both the above problems.  \\nAVL Tree is a binary search tree in which the difference between the height of left sub tree and the \\nheight of right sub tree must be less than equal to one. The condition can be represented by \\nfollowing equation. \\nHL ~ HR <=1 \\nHL is Height of Left sub tree \\nHR is Height of Right sub-tree. \\nSince the tree will be balanced therefore it is called as Height Balance tree or Balanced Binary Search \\nTree. \\nAVL Tree must satisfy the following properties: \\n1. The difference between the height of left sub tree and the height of right sub tree \\nmust be less than equal to one.  \\n2. A new node can be added to the AVL tree only if the tree is balanced.  \\n3. All the nodes must have balance factor either 0 or 1. \\n \\nHow to Balance Binary search tree: Use rotation by finding the unbalancing is due to which sub \\ntree. \\n1. If the tree is unbalance due to the height of left sub tree then rotate the tree in to \\nright hand side.

In a map, various cities are connected using links. These links can be considered as roads, \\nrailway lines or aerial network. Leonhard Euler was a scientist and he used graph theory to solve \\nSeven Bridges of Konigsberg problem in 1736. He laid the foundations of Graph Theory idea of \\ntopology. The problem of Konigsberg bridge was to find whether there is a possible way to traverse \\nevery bridge exactly once.This is shown in below in figure (a) and is called as Euler’s Tour. \\n \\nFigure: (a) Seven Bridges of Konigsberg and (b) Graphical Representation of figure (a) \\nAs we can see the graphical representation of Konigsberg’s seven bridges in figure b, here the points \\nA, B, C and D are called as Vertex in graph terminologies and the paths joining to these vertices are \\ncalled as edges.  \\nWe can represent any graphical scenario with the help of graphs and find a solution for the same.  \\nApplications of Graphs in real life: \\n1. Solving Electricity Distribution problem \\n2. Maps like Cities, Rivers, Countries and so on \\n3. Water distribution in various areas \\n4. CAD/CAM applications \\n5. Finding Disaster Relief Solutions \\n12.2 Basic Concepts of Graphs \\nNodes / Vertices: A graph contains a set of points known as nodes or vertices \\nEdge / Link / Arc: A link joining any two-vertex known as edge or Arc. \\nGraph:A graph is a collection of vertices and arcs which connects vertices in the graph.  \\nA graph G is represented as G = (V, E), where V is set of vertices and E is set of edges. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nExample: Graph G can be defined as G = (V, E) where, \\nV = {A,B,C,D,E} and  \\nE = {(A,B),(A,C)(A,D),(B,D),(C,D),(B,E),(E,D)}.  \\nVertices \\nA \\ngr\\nap\\nh \\nis \\nde\\nfin\\ned \\nas \\nGr\\nap\\nh \\nis\\nB \\ngr\\nap\\nh \\nis \\nde\\nfin\\ned \\nas \\nGr\\nap\\nh \\nis\\nC \\ngr\\nap\\nh \\nis \\nde\\nfin\\ned \\nas \\nGr\\nD\\nDg\\nra\\nph \\nis \\nde\\nfin\\ned \\nas \\nGr\\nE \\ngr\\nap\\nh \\nis \\nde\\nfin\\ned \\nas \\nGr\\nap\\nh\\nEdges \\n\\n\\nPage 276:\\n \\n \\nThis is a graph with 5 vertices and 6 edges. \\nGraph Terminology \\n1. Vertex: An individual data element of a graph is called as Vertex. Vertex is also \\nknown as node.  \\nIn above example graph, A, B, C, D & E are known as vertices. \\n2. Edge: An edge is a connecting link between two vertices. Edge is also known as Arc. \\nAn edge is represented as (starting Vertex, ending Vertex). \\nExample: In above graph, the link between vertices A and B is represented as (A,B) \\n \\nEdges are of three types: \\na. Undirected Edge- An undirected edge is a bidirectional edge. If there is an \\nundirected edge between vertices Aand B then edge (A, B) is equal to edge (B, \\nA). \\nb. Directed Edge - A directed edge is a unidirectional edge. If there is a directed \\nedge between vertices A and B then edge (A, B) is not equal to edge (B, A). \\nc. Weighted Edge - A weighted edge is an edge with cost as weight on it. \\n \\n3. Degree of a Vertex: The degree of a vertex is said to the number of edges incident \\non it. \\nEuler showed that there is a path beginning at any vertex, going through each edgeexactly \\nonce and terminating at the start vertex iff the degree of each, vertex is even. A walk which \\ndoes this is called Eulerian. \\nEx: There is no Eulerian walk for the Koenigsberg bridge problem as all four vertices are of \\nodd degree. \\n4. Outgoing Edge: A directed edge is said to be outgoing edge on its origin vertex. \\n5. Incoming Edge: A directed edge is said to be incoming edge on its destination \\nvertex. \\n6. Degree: Total number of edges connected to a vertex is said to be degree of that \\nvertex. \\n7. Indegree: Total number of incoming edges connected to a vertex is said to be \\nindegree of that vertex. \\n8. Outdegree: Total number of outgoing edges connected to a vertex is said to be \\noutdegree of that vertex. \\n9. Parallel edges or Multiple edges: If there are two undirected edges to have the \\nsame end vertices, and for two directed edges to have the same origin and the \\nsame destination. Such edges are called parallel edges or multiple edges. \\n10. Self-loop: An edge (undirected or directed) is a self-loop if its two endpoints \\ncoincide. \\n11. Simple Graph \\n12. A graph is said to be simple if there are no parallel and self-loop edges. \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 277:\\n \\n \\n12.2.1 Types of Graphs \\n1. Undirected Graph: A graph with only undirected edges is said to be undirected \\ngraph. \\n \\n2. Directed Graph:A graph with only directed edges is said to be directed graph.  \\n \\n3. Complete Graph: A graph in which any V node is adjacent to all other nodes present \\nin the graph is known as a complete graph. An undirected graph contains the edges \\nthat are equal to edges = n(n-1)/2 where n is the number of vertices present in the \\ngraph. The following figure shows a complete graph. \\n \\n4. Regular Graph: Regular graph is the graph in which nodes are adjacent to each \\nother, i.e., each node is accessible from any other node. \\n \\n5. Cycle Graph: A graph having cycle is called cycle graph. In this case the first and last \\nnodes are the same. A closed simple path is a cycle. \\n\\n\\nPage 278:\\n \\n \\n \\n6. Acyclic Graph: A graph without cycle is called acyclic graphs. \\n \\n7. Weighted Graph: A graph is said to be weighted if there are some non-negative \\nvalue assigned to each edges of the graph. The value is equal to the length between \\ntwo vertices. Weighted graph is also called a network. \\n \\n12.2.2 Representing Graphs \\nGraph data structure is represented using following representation types: \\n1. Adjacency Matrix  \\n2. Adjacency List  \\n3. Adjacency Multi-list  \\n \\n10.2.2.1Adjacency Matrix \\nIn this representation, graph can be represented using a matrix of size total number of vertices \\nby total number of vertices; means if a graph with 4 vertices can be represented using a matrix \\nof 4X4 size.  \\nIn this matrix, rows and columns both represent vertices. This matrix is filled with either 1 or 0. \\nHere, 1 represents there is an edge from row vertex to column vertex and 0 represents there is \\nno edge from row vertex to column vertex.  \\nAdjacency Matrix: Let G = (V, E) with n vertices, n \\uf0b3 1. The adjacency matrix of G is a 2-\\ndimensional n \\uf0b4 n matrix, A, A(i, j) = 1 iff (vi , vj) \\uf0ceE(G) (\\uf0e1vi , vj\\uf0f1 for a diagraph), A(i, j) = 0 \\notherwise.  \\nExample: For undirected graph \\n\\n\\nPage 279:\\n \\n \\n \\nFor a Directed graph \\n \\nThe adjacency matrix for an undirected graph is symmetric but the adjacency matrix for a \\ndigraph need not be symmetric.  \\nMerits of Adjacency Matrix: From the adjacency matrix, to determine the connection of vertices \\nis easy. \\nThe degree of a vertex is  \\n \\nFor a digraph, the row sum is the out_degree, while the column sum is the in_degree. \\n \\nThe space needed to represent a graph using adjacency matrix is n2 bits. To identify the edges in \\na graph, adjacency matrices will require at least O(n2) time. \\n2. Adjacency List  \\nIn this representation, every vertex of graph contains list of its adjacent vertices. The n rows of \\nthe adjacency matrix are represented as n chains. The nodes in chain I represent the vertices \\nthat are adjacent to vertex i.  \\nIt can be represented in two forms. In one form, array is used to store n vertices and chain is \\nused to store its adjacencies. Example: \\n \\nSo that we can access the adjacency list for any vertex in O(1) time.  \\nAdjlist[i] is a pointer to to first node in the adjacency list for vertex i. Structure is  \\n#define MAX_VERTICES 50  \\n\\n\\nPage 280:\\n \\n \\ntypedef struct node *node_pointer; \\ntypedef struct node { int vertex; struct node *link; }; \\nnode_pointergraph[MAX_VERTICES];  \\nint n=0; /* vertices currently in use */  \\nAnother type of representation is given below.  \\nExample: Consider the following directed graph representation implemented using linked list. \\n \\nThis representation can also be implemented using array \\n \\n12.2.2.2 Adjacency List: \\nSequential representation of adjacency list and its conversion to graph is: \\n \\nInstead of chains, we can use sequential representation into an integer array with size n+2e+1.  \\nFor 0<=i<n, Array[i] gives starting point of the list for vertex I, and array[n] is set to n+2e+1. The \\nadjacent vertices of node I are stored sequentially from array[i]. \\nFor an undirected graph with n vertices and e edges, linked adjacency list requires an array of \\nsize n and 2e chain nodes. For a directed graph, the number of list nodes is only e. the out \\ndegree of any vertex may be determined by counting the number of nodes in its adjacency list. \\nTo find in-degree of vertex v, we must traverse complete list. \\nTo avoid this, inverse adjacency list is used which contain in-degree. \\n\\n\\nPage 281:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n12.2.2.3 Adjacency Multi-lists \\nIn the adjacency-list representation of an undirected graph each edge (u, v) is represented by two \\nentries one onthe list for u and the other on tht list for v. As we shall see in some situations it is \\nnecessary to be able to determine ie ~ ndenty for a particular edge and mark that edge as having \\nbeen examined. This can be accomplished easilyif the adjacency lists are actually maintained as \\nmultilists (i.e., lists in which nodes may be shared among severallists). For each edge there will be \\nexactly one node but this node will be in two lists (i.e. the adjacency lists foreach of the two nodes to \\nwhich it is incident). \\nFor adjacency multilists, node structure is \\ntypedef struct edge *edge_pointer; \\ntypedef struct edge { \\n short int marked; \\n int vertex1, vertex2; \\nedge_pointer path1, path2; \\n}; \\nedge_pointergraph[MAX_VERTICES]; \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 282:\\n \\n \\n12.2.2.4 Weighted edges \\nIn many applications the edges of a graph have weights assigned to them. These weights may \\nrepresent the distance from one vertex to another or the cost of going from one; vertex to an \\nadjacent vertex In these applications the adjacency matrix entries A [i][j] would keep this information \\ntoo. When adjacency lists are used the weight information may be kept in the list’s nodes by \\nincluding an additional field weight. A graph with weighted edges is called a network. \\n \\n \\n \\n12.2.3 Operations on Graphs \\n \\nGiven a graph G = (V E) and a vertex v in V(G) we wish to visit all vertices in G that are reachable from \\nv (i.e., all vertices that are connected to v). We shall look at two ways of doing this: depth-first search \\nand breadth-first search. Although these methods work on both directed and undirected graphs the \\nfollowing discussion assumes that the graphs are undirected. \\n12.2.3.1 Depth-First Search \\n Begin the search by visiting the start vertex v \\no If v has an unvisited neighbor, traverse it recursively \\no Otherwise, backtrack \\n Time complexity \\no Adjacency list: O(|E|) \\no Adjacency matrix: O(|V|2) \\nWe begin by visiting the start vertex v. Next an unvisited vertex w adjacent to v is selected, and a \\ndepth-first search from w is initiated. When a vertex u is reached such that all its adjacent vertices \\nhave been visited, we back up to the last vertex visited that has an unvisited vertex w adjacent to it \\nand initiate a depth-first search from w. \\nThe search terminates when no unvisited vertex can be reached from any of the visited vertices. DFS \\ntraversal of a graph, produces a spanning tree as final result. Spanning Tree is a graph without any \\nloops. \\nWe use Stack data structure with maximum size of total number of vertices in the graph to \\nimplement DFS traversal of a graph. \\nWe use the following steps to implement DFS traversal... \\nStep 1: Define a Stack of size total number of vertices in the graph. \\nStep 2: Select any vertex as starting point for traversal. Visit that vertex and push it on to the Stack. \\nStep 3: Visit any one of the adjacent vertex of the verex which is at top of the stack which is not \\nvisited and push it on to the stack. \\n\\n\\nPage 283:\\n \\n \\nStep 4: Repeat step 3 until there are no new vertex to be visit from the vertex on top of the stack. \\nStep 5: When there is no new vertex to be visit then use back tracking and pop one vertex from the \\nstack. \\nStep 6: Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 until stack becomes Empty. \\nStep 7: When stack becomes Empty, then produce final spanning tree by removing unused edges \\nfrom the graph. \\nThis function is best described recursively as in Program. \\n \\n#define FALSE 0 \\n#define TRUE 1 \\nint visited[MAX_VERTICES]; \\nvoid dfs(int v) \\n{ \\nnode_pointerw; \\n visited[v]= TRUE; \\nprintf(“%d”, v); \\n for (w=graph[v]; w; w=w->link) \\n if (!visited[w->vertex]) \\ndfs(w->vertex); \\n} \\nConsider the graph G of Figure 6.16(a), which is represented by its adjacency lists as in Figure 6.16(b). \\nIf a depthfirst search is initiated from vertex 0 then the vertices of G are visited in the following \\norder: 0 1 3 7 4 5 2 6. \\nSince DFS(O) visits all vertices that can be reached from 0 the vertices visited, together with all edges \\nin G incident to these vertices form a connected component of G. \\n \\nAnalysis or DFS: \\nWhen G is represented by its adjacency lists, the vertices w adjacent to v can be determined by \\nfollowing a chain of links. Since DFS examines each node in the adjacency lists at most once and there \\nare 2e list nodes the time to complete the search is O(e). If G is represented by its adjacency matrix \\nthen the time to determine all vertices adjacent to v is O(n). Since at most n vertices are visited the \\ntotal time is O(n2). \\n12.2.3.2 Breadth-First Search \\nIn a breadth-first search, we begin by visiting the start vertex v. Next all unvisited vertices adjacent to \\nv are \\n\\n\\nPage 284:\\n \\n \\nvisited. Unvisited vertices adjacent to these newly visited vertices are then visited and so on. \\nAlgorithm BFS. \\nProgram: \\ntypedef struct queue *queue_pointer; \\ntypedef struct queue { \\n int vertex; \\nqueue_pointerlink; \\n}; \\nvoid addq(queue_pointer *, \\nqueue_pointer *, int); \\nint deleteq(queue_pointer *); \\nvoid bfs(int v) \\n{ \\nnode_pointerw; \\nqueue_pointer front, rear; \\n front = rear = NULL; \\nprintf(“%d”, v); \\n visited[v] = TRUE; \\naddq(&front, &rear, v); \\nwhile (front) { \\n v= deleteq(&front); \\n for (w=graph[v]; w; w=w->link) \\n if (!visited[w->vertex]) { \\nprintf(“%d”, w->vertex); \\naddq(&front, &rear, w->vertex); \\n visited[w->vertex] = TRUE; \\n } \\n } \\n} \\nSteps: \\nBFS traversal of a graph, produces a spanning tree as final result. Spanning Tree is a graph without \\nany loops. We use Queue data structure with maximum size of total number of vertices in the graph \\nto implement BFS traversal of a graph. \\nWe use the following steps to implement BFS traversal... \\nStep 1: Define a Queue of size total number of vertices in the graph. \\nStep 2: Select any vertex as starting point for traversal. Visit that vertex and insert it into the Queue. \\nStep 3: Visit all the adjacent vertices of the vertex which is at front of the Queue which is not visited \\nand insert them into the Queue. \\nStep 4: When there is no new vertex to be visit from the vertex at front of the Queue then delete \\nthat vertex from the Queue. \\nStep 5: Repeat step 3 and 4 until queue becomes empty. \\nStep 6: When queue becomes Empty, then produce final spanning tree by removing unused edges \\nfrom the graph \\nAnalysis of BFS: \\nEach visited vertex enters the queue exactly once. So the while loop is iterated at most n times If an \\nadjacency matrix is used the loop takes O(n) time for each vertex visited. The total time is therefore, \\nO(n2 ). If adjacency lists are used the loop has a total cost of d0 + … + dn-1 = O(e), where d is the \\ndegree of vertex i. As in the case of DFS all visited vertices together with all edges incident to them, \\nform a connected component of G. \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 285:\\n \\n \\n12.2.3.3 Connected Components \\nIf G is an undirected graph, then one can determine whether or not it is connected by simply making \\na call to either DFS or BFS and then determining if there is any unvisited vertex. The connected \\ncomponents of a graph may be obtained by making repeated calls to either DFS(v) or BFS(v); where v \\nis a vertex that has not yet been visited. This leads to function Connected as given below in program \\nwhich determines the connected components of G. The algorithm uses DFS (BFS may be used instead \\nif desired). The computing time is not affected. Function connected –Output outputs all vertices \\nvisited in the most recent invocation of DFS together with all edges incident on these vertices. \\nvoid connected(void){ \\n for (i=0; i<n; i++) { \\n if (!visited[i]) { \\ndfs(i); \\nprintf(“\\\\n”); } } } \\nAnalysis of Components: \\nIf G is represented by its adjacency lists, then the total time taken by dfs is O(e). Since the for loops \\ntake O(n) time, the total time to generate all the Connected components is O(n+e). If adjacency \\nmatrices are used, then the time required is O(n2). \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 286:\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 287:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nConsider the following example for BFS traversal. \\n\\n\\nPage 288:\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 289:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n12.3 Graph Traversals \\nUnlike linear data structures (Array, Linked List, Queues, Stacks, etc) which have only one logical way \\nto traverse them, trees can be traversed in different ways.

Explain Greedy Algorithms. \\n13.1 Introduction \\nA graph is a common data structure that consists of a finite set of nodes (or vertices) and a set of \\nedges connecting them. \\nA pair (x,y) is referred to as an edge, which communicates that the x vertex connects to the y vertex. \\nIn the examples below, circles represent vertices, while lines represent edges. \\n\\n\\nPage 294:\\n \\n \\n \\nGraphs are used to solve real-life problems that involve representation of the problem space as a \\nnetwork. Examples of networks include telephone networks, circuit networks, social networks (like \\nLinkedIn, Facebook etc.). \\nFor example, a single user in Facebook can be represented as a node (vertex) while their connection \\nwith others can be represented as an edge between nodes. \\nEach node can be a structure that contains information like user’s id, name, gender, etc. \\nTypes of graphs: \\nA. Undirected Graph: \\nIn an undirected graph, nodes are connected by edges that are all bidirectional. For example, if an \\nedge connects node 1 and 2, we can traverse from node 1 to node 2, and from node 2 to 1. \\n \\nB. Directed Graph \\nIn a directed graph, nodes are connected by directed edges – they only go in one direction. For \\nexample, if an edge connects node 1 and 2, but the arrowhead points towards 2, we can only \\ntraverse from node 1 to node 2 – not in the opposite direction. \\nTypes of Graph Representations: \\nA. Adjacency List \\nTo create an Adjacency list, an array of lists is used. The size of the array is equal to the number of \\nnodes. \\nA single index, array[i] represents the list of nodes adjacent to the ith node. \\n\\n\\nPage 295:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nB. Adjacency Matrix: \\nAn Adjacency Matrix is a 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of nodes in a graph. A slot \\nmatrix[i][j] = 1 indicates that there is an edge from node i to node j. \\n \\n13.2 Minimum Spanning Tree \\n13.2.1 Spanning Tree \\nA spanning tree is a subset of Graph G, which has all the vertices covered with \\nminimum possible number of edges. Hence, a spanning tree does not have cycles and \\nit cannot be disconnected. \\n\\n\\nPage 296:\\n \\n \\nBy this definition, we can draw a conclusion that every connected and undirected \\nGraph G has at least one spanning tree. A disconnected graph does not have any \\nspanning tree, as it cannot be spanned to all its vertices. \\nGiven an undirected and connected graph G=(V, E), a spanning tree of the graph G is \\na tree that spans G (that is, it includes every vertex of G) and is a subgraph \\nof G (every edge in the tree belongs to G).  \\nFollowing figure shows the original undirected graph and its various possible \\nspanning trees.  \\n \\nWe found three spanning trees off one complete graph. A complete undirected graph \\ncan have maximum nn-2 number of spanning trees, where n is the number of nodes. In \\nthe above addressed example, n is 3, hence 33−2 = 3 spanning trees are possible. \\nGeneral Properties of Spanning Tree \\nAs one graph can have more than one spanning tree. Following are a few properties \\nof the spanning tree connected to graph G − \\n1. A connected graph G can have more than one spanning tree. \\n\\n\\nPage 297:\\n \\n \\n2. All possible spanning trees of graph G, have the same number of edges and \\nvertices. \\n3. The spanning tree does not have any cycle (loops). \\n4. Removing one edge from the spanning tree will make the graph disconnected, \\ni.e. the spanning tree is minimally connected. \\n5. Adding one edge to the spanning tree will create a circuit or loop, i.e. the \\nspanning tree is maximally acyclic. \\n \\nMathematical Properties of Spanning Tree \\n1. \\nSpanning tree has n-1 edges, where n is the \\nnumber of nodes (vertices). \\n2. \\nFrom \\na \\ncomplete \\ngraph, \\nby \\nremoving \\nmaximum e - n + 1 edges, we can construct a spanning tree. \\n3. \\nA complete graph can have maximum nn-2 \\nnumber of spanning trees. \\n4. \\nThus, we can conclude that spanning trees are a \\nsubset of connected Graph G and disconnected graphs do not have spanning \\ntree. \\nApplication of Spanning Tree \\nSpanning tree is basically used to find a minimum path to connect all nodes in a \\ngraph. Common application of spanning trees are − \\n\\uf0b7 \\nCivil Network Planning \\n\\uf0b7 \\nComputer Network Routing Protocol \\n\\uf0b7 \\nCluster Analysis \\n \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 298:\\n \\n \\n13.2.2 Minimum Spanning Tree \\nThe cost of the spanning tree is the sum of the weights of all the edges in the tree. \\nThere can be many spanning trees. Minimum spanning tree is the spanning tree \\nwhere the cost is minimum among all the spanning trees. There also can be many \\nminimum spanning trees. \\nMinimum spanning tree has direct application in the design of networks. It is used in \\nalgorithms approximating the travelling salesman problem, multi-terminal minimum \\ncut problem and minimum cost weighted perfect matching. Other practical \\napplications are: \\n1. Cluster Analysis \\n2. Handwriting recognition \\n3. Image segmentation \\n \\nThere are two famous algorithms for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree: \\n1. Kruskal’s Algorithm \\n2. Prim’s Algorithm \\nThese both algorithms are Greedy Algorithms. \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 299:\\n \\n \\n13.3 Graph Algorithms \\n13.3.1 Kruskal’s Algorithm \\nKruskal’s Algorithm builds the spanning tree by adding edges one by one into a growing spanning \\ntree. Kruskal\\'s algorithm follows greedy approach as in each iteration it finds an edge which has least \\nweight and add it to the growing spanning tree. \\nAlgorithm Steps: \\n1. Sort the graph edges with respect to their weights. \\n2. Start adding edges to the MST from the edge with the smallest weight until the edge of the \\nlargest weight. \\n3. Only add edges which doesn\\'t form a cycle , edges which connect only disconnected \\ncomponents. \\nSo now the question is how to check if 2 vertices are connected or not ? \\nThis could be done using DFS which starts from the first vertex, then check if the second vertex is \\nvisited or not. But DFS will make time complexity large as it has an order of O(V+E) where V is the \\nnumber of vertices, E is the number of edges. So the best solution is \"Disjoint Sets\". \\n \\nDisjointSets: \\nDisjoint sets are sets whose intersection is the empty set so it means that they don\\'t have any \\nelement in common. \\nConsider following example: \\n\\n\\nPage 300:\\n \\n \\n \\nIn Kruskal’s algorithm, at each iteration we will select the edge with the lowest weight. So, we will \\nstart with the lowest weighted edge first i.e., the edges with weight 1. After that we will select the \\nsecond lowest weighted edge i.e., edge with weight 2. Notice these two edges are totally disjoint. \\nNow, the next edge will be the third lowest weighted edge i.e., edge with weight 3, which connects \\nthe two disjoint pieces of the graph. Now, we are not allowed to pick the edge with weight 4, that \\nwill create a cycle and we can’t have any cycles. So we will select the fifth lowest weighted edge i.e., \\nedge with weight 5. Now the other two edges will create cycles so we will ignore them. In the end, \\nwe end up with a minimum spanning tree with total cost 11 ( = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5). \\nProgram: \\n#include <iostream> \\n#include <vector> \\n#include <utility> \\n#include <algorithm> \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 301:\\n \\n \\nusing namespace std; \\nconst int MAX = 1e4 + 5; \\nint id[MAX], nodes, edges; \\npair <long long, pair<int, int>> p[MAX]; \\n \\nvoid initialize() \\n{ \\nfor(int i = 0;i < MAX;++i) \\n        id[i] = i; \\n} \\n \\nint root(int x) \\n{ \\n    while(id[x] != x) \\n    { \\n        id[x] = id[id[x]]; \\n        x = id[x]; \\n    } \\n    return x; \\n} \\n \\nvoid union1(int x, int y) \\n{ \\n    int p = root(x); \\n    int q = root(y); \\n    id[p] = id[q]; \\n\\n\\nPage 302:\\n \\n \\n} \\n \\nlong longkruskal(pair<long long, pair<int, int>> p[]) \\n{ \\n    int x, y; \\n    long long cost, minimumCost = 0; \\nfor(int i = 0;i < edges;++i) \\n    { \\n        // Selecting edges one by one in increasing order from the beginning \\n        x = p[i].second.first; \\n        y = p[i].second.second; \\n        cost = p[i].first; \\n        // Check if the selected edge is creating a cycle or not \\n        if(root(x) != root(y)) \\n        { \\nminimumCost += cost; \\n            union1(x, y); \\n        }     \\n    } \\n    return minimumCost; \\n} \\n \\nint main() \\n{ \\n    int x, y; \\n    long long weight, cost, minimumCost; \\n\\n\\nPage 303:\\n \\n \\ninitialize(); \\ncin>> nodes >>edges; \\nfor(int i = 0;i < edges;++i) \\n    { \\ncin>> x >> y >>weight; \\n        p[i] = make_pair(weight, make_pair(x, y)); \\n    } \\n    // Sort the edges in the ascending order \\nsort(p, p + edges); \\nminimumCost = kruskal(p); \\ncout<<minimumCost<<endl; \\n    return 0; \\n} \\nTimeComplexity: \\nTime Complexity: \\nIn Kruskal’s algorithm, most time consuming operation is sorting because the total complexity of the \\nDisjoint-Set operations will be O(E log V), which is the overall Time Complexity of the algorithm. \\n \\n13.3.2 Prim’s Algorithm \\nPrim’s Algorithm also use Greedy approach to find the minimum spanning tree. In Prim’s Algorithm \\nwe grow the spanning tree from a starting position. Unlike an edge in Kruskal\\'s, we add vertex to the \\ngrowing spanning tree in Prim\\'s. \\nAlgorithm Steps: \\n1. Maintain two disjoint sets of vertices. One containing vertices that are in the \\ngrowing spanning tree and other that are not in the growing spanning tree. \\n2. Select the cheapest vertex that is connected to the growing spanning tree and is not \\nin the growing spanning tree and add it into the growing spanning tree. This can be \\n\\n\\nPage 304:\\n \\n \\ndone using Priority Queues. Insert the vertices, that are connected to growing \\nspanning tree, into the Priority Queue. \\n3. Check for cycles. To do that, mark the nodes which have been already selected and \\ninsert only those nodes in the Priority Queue that are not marked. \\nConsider the example below: \\n \\nIn Prim’s Algorithm, we will start with an arbitrary node (it doesn’t matter which one) and mark it. In \\neach iteration we will mark a new vertex that is adjacent to the one that we have already marked. As \\na greedy algorithm, Prim’s algorithm will select the cheapest edge and mark the vertex. So we will \\nsimply choose the edge with weight 1. In the next iteration we have three options, edges with weight \\n2, 3 and 4. So, we will select the edge with weight 2 and mark the vertex. Now again we have three \\noptions, edges with weight 3, 4 and 5. But we can’t choose edge with weight 3 as it is creating a cycle. \\nSo we will select the edge with weight 4 and we end up with the minimum spanning tree of total cost \\n7 ( = 1 + 2 +4). \\nProgram: \\n#include <iostream> \\n#include <vector> \\n#include <queue> \\n\\n\\nPage 305:\\n \\n \\n#include <functional> \\n#include <utility> \\n \\nusing namespace std; \\nconst int MAX = 1e4 + 5; \\ntypedef pair<long long, int>PII; \\nbool marked[MAX]; \\nvector <PII>adj[MAX]; \\n \\nlong longprim(int x) \\n{ \\npriority_queue<PII, vector<PII>, greater<PII>>Q; \\n    int y; \\n    long longminimumCost = 0; \\n    PII p; \\nQ.push(make_pair(0, x)); \\n    while(!Q.empty()) \\n    { \\n        // Select the edge with minimum weight \\n        p = Q.top(); \\nQ.pop(); \\n        x = p.second; \\n        // Checking for cycle \\n        if(marked[x] == true) \\ncontinue; \\nminimumCost += p.first; \\n\\n\\nPage 306:\\n \\n \\n        marked[x] = true; \\nfor(int i = 0;i <adj[x].size();++i) \\n        { \\n            y = adj[x][i].second; \\n            if(marked[y] == false) \\nQ.push(adj[x][i]); \\n        } \\n    } \\n    return minimumCost; \\n} \\n \\nint main() \\n{ \\n    int nodes, edges, x, y; \\n    long long weight, minimumCost; \\ncin>> nodes >>edges; \\nfor(int i = 0;i < edges;++i) \\n    { \\ncin>> x >> y >>weight; \\nadj[x].push_back(make_pair(weight, y)); \\nadj[y].push_back(make_pair(weight, x)); \\n    } \\n    // Selecting 1 as the starting node \\nminimumCost = prim(1); \\ncout<<minimumCost<<endl; \\n    return 0; \\n\\n\\nPage 307:\\n \\n \\n} \\nTime Complexity:  \\nThe time complexity of the Prim’s Algorithm is O((V+E)logV) because each vertex is inserted in the \\npriority queue only once and insertion in priority queue take logarithmic time. \\n \\n13.3 Summary \\n \\nIn this chapter, we have studied Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and its use in various \\nalgorithms like Kruskal’s Algorithm, Prim’s Algorithm.

Likewise, \\nthe more we are connected with people, the nodes and edges of the graph keep on \\nincreasing. \\n \\nSimilarly, Google Map is another example where Graphs are used. In the case of \\nthe Google Map, every location is considered as nodes, and roads between \\nlocations are considered as edges. And, when one has to move from one location \\nto another, the Google Map uses various Graph-based algorithms to find the \\nshortest path. We will discuss this later in this blog. \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 311:\\n \\n \\n \\nNeed for Dynamic Graph Algorithms: \\nThe goal of a dynamic graph algorithm is to support query and update operations as \\nquickly as possible (usually much faster than recomputing from scratch). Graphs \\nsubject to insertions only, or deletions only, but not both. Graphs subject to \\nintermixed sequences of insertions and deletions. \\n14.2 Dynamic Graph Algorithms \\nLet us say that we have a machine, and to determine its state at time t, we have \\ncertain quantities called state variables. There will be certain times when we have to \\nmake a decision which affects the state of the system, which may or may not be \\nknown to us in advance. These decisions or changes are equivalent to transformations \\nof state variables. The results of the previous decisions help us in choosing the future \\nones. \\nWhat do we conclude from this? We need to break up a problem into a series of \\noverlapping sub-problems and build up solutions to larger and larger sub-problems. If \\nyou are given a problem, which can be broken down into smaller sub-problems, and \\nthese smaller sub-problems can still be broken into smaller ones - and if you manage \\nto find out that there are some overlapping sub-problems, then you\\'ve encountered a \\nDP problem. \\nSome famous Dynamic Programming algorithms are: \\n\\uf0b7 Unix diff for comparing two files \\n\\uf0b7 Bellman-Ford for shortest path routing in networks \\n\\uf0b7 TeX the ancestor of LaTeX \\n\\uf0b7 WASP - Winning and Score Predictor \\nThe core idea of Dynamic Programming is to avoid repeated work by remembering \\npartial results and this concept finds it application in a lot of real life situations. \\nIn programming, Dynamic Programming is a powerful technique that allows one to \\nsolve different types of problems in time O(n2) or O(n3) for which a naive approach \\nwould take exponential time. \\n\\n\\nPage 312:\\n \\n \\nDynamic Programming and Recursion: \\nDynamic programming is basically, recursion plus using common sense. What it \\nmeans is that recursion allows you to express the value of a function in terms of other \\nvalues of that function. Where the common sense tells you that if you implement your \\nfunction in a way that the recursive calls are done in advance, and stored for easy \\naccess, it will make your program faster. This is what we call Memorization - it is \\nmemorizing the results of some specific states, which can then be later accessed to \\nsolve other sub-problems. \\nThe intuition behind dynamic programming is that we trade space for time, i.e. to say \\nthat instead of calculating all the states taking a lot of time but no space, we take up \\nspace to store the results of all the sub-problems to save time later. \\nLet\\'s try to understand this by taking an example of Fibonacci numbers. \\nFibonacci (n) = 1; if n = 0 \\nFibonacci (n) = 1; if n = 1 \\nFibonacci (n) = Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2) \\nSo, the first few numbers in this series will be: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21... and so on! \\n \\nMajority of the Dynamic Programming problems can be categorized into two types: \\n1. Optimization problems. \\n2. Combinatorial problems. \\nThe optimization problems expect you to select a feasible solution, so that the value \\nof the required function is minimized or maximized. Combinatorial problems expect \\nyou to figure out the number of ways to do something, or the probability of some \\nevent happening. \\nEvery Dynamic Programming problem has a schema to be followed: \\n\\uf0b7 Show that the problem can be broken down into optimal sub-problems. \\n\\uf0b7 Recursively define the value of the solution by expressing it in terms of \\noptimal solutions for smaller sub-problems. \\n\\uf0b7 Compute the value of the optimal solution in bottom-up fashion. \\n\\uf0b7 Construct an optimal solution from the computed information. \\n\\n\\nPage 313:\\n \\n \\nBottom up vs. Top Down: \\nBottom Up - I\\'m going to learn programming. Then, I will start practicing. Then, I \\nwill start taking part in contests. Then, I\\'ll practice even more and try to improve. \\nAfter working hard like crazy, I\\'ll be an amazing coder. \\nTop Down - I will be an amazing coder. How? I will work hard like crazy. How? I\\'ll \\npractice more and try to improve. How? I\\'ll start taking part in contests. Then? I\\'ll \\npracticing. How?

Floyd Warshall Algorithm is an example of dynamic \\nprogramming approach. \\nFloyd Warshall’s Algorithm has the following main advantages- \\n1. It is extremely simple. \\n2. It is easy to implement. \\n \\nAlgorithm Steps: \\n1. \\nInitialize the solution matrix same as the input graph matrix as a first step.  \\n2. \\nThen update the solution matrix by considering all vertices as an intermediate \\nvertex. The idea is to one by one pick all vertices and updates all shortest paths \\n\\n\\nPage 314:\\n \\n \\nwhich include the picked vertex as an intermediate vertex in the shortest path. \\nWhen we pick vertex number k as an intermediate vertex, we already have \\nconsidered vertices {0, 1, 2, .. k-1} as intermediate vertices. For every pair (i, \\nj) of the source and destination vertices respectively, there are two possible \\ncases.  \\n\\uf0b7 k is not an intermediate vertex in shortest path from i to j. We keep the value \\nof dist[i][j] as it is.  \\n\\uf0b7 k is an intermediate vertex in shortest path from i to j. We update the value of \\ndist[i][j] as dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] if dist[i][j] >dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] \\n \\nThe following figure shows the above optimal substructure property in the all-pairs \\nshortest path problem. \\n \\n \\n \\nProgram: \\n// C++ Program for Floyd Warshall Algorithm  \\n#include <bits/stdc++.h> \\nusing namespace std; \\n \\n// Number of vertices in the graph  \\n#define V 4  \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 315:\\n \\n \\n/* Define Infinite as a large enough value.This value will be used for vertices not \\nconnected to each other */ \\n#define INF 99999  \\n \\n// A function to print the solution matrix  \\nvoid printSolution(int dist[][V]);  \\n \\n// Solves the all-pairs shortest path problem using Floyd Warshall algorithm  \\nvoid floydWarshall (int graph[][V])  \\n{  \\n \\n/* dist[][] will be the output matrix that will finally have the shortest distances \\nbetween every pair of vertices */ \\n \\nint dist[V][V], i, j, k; \\n \\n \\n/* Initialize the solution matrix same  \\nas input graph matrix.

Using Floyd Warshall Algorithm, \\nfind the shortest path distance between every pair of vertices. \\n \\nStep-1: \\n\\uf0b7 Remove all the self-loops and parallel edges (keeping the lowest weight edge) \\nfrom the graph. \\n\\uf0b7 In the given graph, there are neither self-edges nor parallel edges. \\n Step-2: \\nWrite the initial distance matrix. \\n\\n\\nPage 319:\\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 It represents the distance between every pair of vertices in the form of given \\nweights. \\n\\uf0b7 For diagonal elements (representing self-loops), distance value = 0. \\n\\uf0b7 For vertices having a direct edge between them, distance value = weight of \\nthat edge. \\n\\uf0b7 For vertices having no direct edge between them, distance value = ∞. \\n Initial distance matrix for the given graph is- \\n \\nStep-3: \\nUsing Floyd Warshall Algorithm, write the following 4 matrices- \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 320:\\n \\n \\nPlease note: \\n\\uf0b7 In the above problem, there are 4 vertices in the given graph. \\n\\uf0b7 So, there will be total 4 matrices of order 4 x 4 in the solution excluding the \\ninitial distance matrix. \\n\\uf0b7 Diagonal elements of each matrix will always be 0. \\nThe last matrix D4 represents the shortest path distance between every pair of \\nvertices. \\n \\n14.2.2 Dijkstra’s Algorithms \\nDijkstra’s algorithm, published in 1959 and named after its creator Dutch computer \\nscientist Edsger Dijkstra, can be applied on a weighted graph. The graph can either be \\ndirected or undirected. One stipulation to using the algorithm is that the graph needs \\nto have a nonnegative weight on every edge. \\nIf you are given a directed or undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. \\nThe weights of all edges are non-negative. You are also given a starting vertex s. To \\nfind the lengths of the shortest paths from a starting vertex s to all other vertices, and \\noutput the shortest paths themselves, we use Dijkstra’s Algorithm. \\nThis problem is also called single-source shortest paths problem. \\nOne algorithm for finding the shortest path from a starting node to a target node in a \\nweighted graph is Dijkstra’s algorithm. The algorithm creates a tree of shortest paths \\nfrom the starting vertex, the source, to all other points in the graph. \\nSuppose a student wants to go from home to school in the shortest possible way. She \\nknows some roads are heavily congested and difficult to use. In Dijkstra\\'s algorithm, \\nthis means the edge has a large weight--the shortest path tree found by the algorithm \\nwill try to avoid edges with larger weights. If the student looks up directions using a \\nmap service, it is likely they may use Dijkstra\\'s algorithm, as well as others. \\nExample: Find the shortest path from home to school in the following graph: \\n\\n\\nPage 321:\\n \\n \\n \\nThe shortest path, which could be found using Dijkstra\\'s algorithm, is \\n \\nHome\\uf0e0B\\uf0e0D\\uf0e0F\\uf0e0School \\nAlgorithm: \\nDijkstra’s algorithm finds a shortest path tree from a single source node, by building \\na set of nodes that have minimum distance from the source. \\nThe graph has the following: \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Vertices, or nodes, denoted in the algorithm by vv or uu; \\n\\uf0b7 Weighted edges that connect two nodes: (u,vu,v) denotes an edge, and \\nw(u,v)w(u,v) denotes its weight. In the diagram on the right, the weight for \\neach edge is written in gray. \\n\\n\\nPage 322:\\n \\n \\nThis is done by initializing three values: \\n\\uf0b7 dist, an array of distances from the source node ss to each node in the graph, \\ninitialized the following way: dist(s) = 0; and for all other nodes v, dist(v)=∞. \\nThis is done at the beginning because as the algorithm proceeds, the dist from \\nthe source to each node v in the graph will be recalculated and finalized when \\nthe shortest distance to v is found \\n\\uf0b7 Q, a queue of all nodes in the graph. At the end of the algorithm\\'s progress, Q \\nwill be empty. \\n\\uf0b7 S, an empty set, to indicate which nodes the algorithm has visited. At the end \\nof the algorithm\\'s run, S will contain all the nodes of the graph. \\n The algorithm proceeds as follows: \\n1. \\nWhile Q is not empty, pop the node v, that is not already in SS, from Q with \\nthe smallest dist (v). In the first run, source node ss will be chosen because \\ndist(s) was initialized to 0. In the next run, the next node with the smallest dist \\nvalue is chosen. \\n2. \\nAdd node v to S, to indicate that v has been visited \\n3. \\nUpdate dist values of adjacent nodes of the current node v as follows: for each \\nnew adjacent node u, \\n4. \\nif dist (v) + weight(u,v) <dist (u), there is a new minimal distance found for u, \\nso update dist(u) to the new minimal distance value; \\n5. \\notherwise, no updates are made to dist(u). \\nThe algorithm has visited all nodes in the graph and found the smallest distance to \\neach node. dist now contains the shortest path tree from source s. \\nNote: The weight of an edge (u,v) is taken from the value associated with (u,v) on the \\ngraph. \\nProgram: \\nfunction Dijkstra(Graph, source): \\ndist[source]  := 0                     // Distance from source to source is set to 0 \\n\\n\\nPage 323:\\n \\n \\n       for each vertex v in Graph:            // Initializations \\n           if v ≠ source \\ndist[v]  := infinity           // Unknown distance function from source to each node set  \\n                                                      // to infinity \\n           add v to Q                         // All nodes initially in Q \\n      while Q is not empty:            // The main loop \\nv := vertex in Q with min dist[v]  // In the first run-through, this vertex is the source \\nnode \\n          remove v from Q  \\n          for each neighbor u of v:           // where neighbor u has not yet been removed \\nfrom Q. \\nalt := dist[v] + length(v, u) \\n              if alt <dist[u]:               // A shorter path to u has been found \\ndist[u]  := alt            // Update distance of u  \\n      return dist[] \\n  end function \\n \\nExample: \\nLet us solve above example using following steps through Dijkstra\\'s algorithm: \\n2. Initialize distances according to the algorithm \\n3. Pick first node and calculate distances to adjacent nodes. \\n4. Pick next node with minimal distance; repeat adjacent node distance calculations. \\n5. Final result of shortest-path tree \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 324:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 325:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n14.3 Applications of Graphs \\n1. \\nIn Computer science graphs are used to represent the flow of computation. \\n2. \\nGoogle maps uses graphs for building transportation systems, where \\nintersection of two (or more) roads are considered to be a vertex and the road \\nconnecting two vertices is considered to be an edge, thus their navigation \\nsystem is based on the algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two \\nvertices. \\n\\uf0b7 Google Maps and Routes APIs are classic Shortest Path APIs. This a \\ngraph problem that\\'s very easy to solve with edge-weighted directed \\ngraphs (digraphs). \\n\\uf0b7 The idea of a Map API is to find the shortest path from one vertex to \\nevery other as in a single source shortest path variant, from your \\ncurrent location to every other destination you might be interested in \\ngoing to on the map. \\n\\uf0b7 The idea of by contrast Routing API to find the shortest path from one \\nvertex to another as in a source sink shortest path variant, from s to t. \\n\\uf0b7 Shortest Path APIs are typically directed graphs. The underlying data \\nstructures and graphs too. \\n3. \\nIn Facebook, users are considered to be the vertices and if they are friends then \\nthere is an edge running between them. Facebook’s Friend suggestion \\nalgorithm uses graph theory. Facebook is an example of undirected graph. \\n\\uf0b7 Facebook\\'s Graph API is perhaps the best example of application of \\ngraphs to real life problems. The Graph API is a revolution in large-\\nscale data provision. \\n\\uf0b7 On The Graph API, everything is a vertice or node. This are entities \\nsuch as Users, Pages, Places, Groups, Comments, Photos, Photo \\nAlbums, Stories, Videos, Notes, Events and so forth. Anything that has \\nproperties that store data is a vertice. \\n\\n\\nPage 326:\\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 And every connection or relationship is an edge. This will be \\nsomething like a User posting a Photo, Video or Comment etc., a User \\nupdating their profile with their Place of birth, a relationship status \\nUsers, a User liking a Friend\\'s Photo etc. \\n\\uf0b7 The Graph API uses this collection of vertices and edges (essentially \\ngraph data structures) to store its data. The Graph API is also a \\nGraphQL API. This is the language it uses to build and query the \\nschema. \\n\\uf0b7 The Graph API has come into some problems because of it\\'s ability to \\nobtain unusually rich info about user\\'s friends. \\n \\n \\n4. \\nIn World Wide Web, web pages are considered to be the vertices. There is an \\nedge from a page u to other page v if there is a link of page v on page u. This is \\nan example of Directed graph. It was the basic idea behind Google Page \\nRanking Algorithm. \\n5. \\nIn Operating System, we come across the Resource Allocation Graph where \\neach process and resources are considered to be vertices. Edges are drawn \\nfrom resources to the allocated process, or from requesting process to the \\nrequested resource. If this leads to any formation of a cycle, then a deadlock \\nwill occur.  \\n\\n\\nPage 327:\\n \\n \\n6. \\nGoogle Knowledge Graph: knowledge graph has something to do with linking \\ndata and graphs...graph-based representation of knowledge. It still isn\\'t what is \\ncan and can\\'t do yet. \\n7. \\nPath Optimization Algorithms: Path optimizations are primarily occupied with \\nfinding the best connection that fits some predefined criteria e.g. speed, safety, \\nfuel etc or set of criteria e.g. prodecures, routes. \\n\\uf0b7 In unweighted graphs, the Shortest Path of a graph is the path with the \\nleast number of edges. Breadth First Search (BFS) is used to find the \\nshortest paths in graphs—we always reach a node from another node in \\nthe fewest number of edges in breadth graph traversals. \\n\\uf0b7 Any Spanning Tree is a Minimum Spanning Tree unweighted graphs \\nusing either BFS or Depth First Search. \\n8. \\nFlight Networks: For flight networks, efficient route optimizations perfectly fit \\ngraph data strutures. Using graph models, airport procedures can be modeled \\nand optimized efficiently. Computing best connections in flight networks is a \\nkey application of algorithm engineering. In flight network, graph data \\nstrutures are used to compute shortest paths and fuel usage in route planning, \\noften in a multi-modal context. The vertices in flight networks are places of \\ndeparture and destination, airports, aircrafts, cargo weights. The flight \\ntrajectories between airports are the edges. Turns out it\\'s very feasible to fit \\ngraph data strutures in route optimizations because of precompiled full \\ndistance tables between all airports. Entities such as flights can have properties \\nsuch as fuel usage, crew pairing which can themselves be more graphs. \\n9. \\nGPS Navigation Systems: Car navigations also use Shortest Path APIs. \\nAlthough this is still a type of a routing API it would differ from the Google \\nMaps Routing API because it is single source (from one vertex to every other \\ni.e. it computes locations from where you are to any other location you might \\nbe interested in going.) BFS is used to find all neighbouring locations. \\n\\n\\nPage 328:\\n \\n \\n14.4 Summary \\nIn previous chapter, we have studied Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and its \\nuse in various algorithms like Kruskal’s Algorithm, Prim’s Algorithm. Based \\non this we have studied all-pair shortest path algorithms like Floyd Warshall’s \\nAlgorithm, Dijkstra’s Algorithm. We have studied the applications of various \\ngraph algorithms and data structures in day-to-day life. \\n14.5 Review Your Learning \\n1.

This in turn helps to determine the way information is stored, retrieved and modified in a computer’s memory. 1.2 BASIC CONCEPT OF DATA STRUCTURE Data structure is a branch of computer science. The study of data structure helps you to understand how data is organized and how data flow is managed to increase efficiency of any process or program. Data structure is the structural representation of logical relationship between data elements. This means that a data structure organizes data items based on the relationship between the data elements. Example: A house can be identified by the house name, location, number of floors and so on. These structured set of variables depend on each other to identify the exact house. Similarly, data structure is a structured set of variables that are linked to each other, which forms the basic component of a system 1.2.1 Basic Terminology Data structures are the building blocks of any program or the software. Choosing the appropriate data structure for a program is the most difficult task for a programmer. Following terminology is used as far as data structures are concerned Data: Data can be defined as an elementary value or the collection of values, for example, student's name and its id are the data about the student. Group Items: Data items which have subordinate data items are called Group item, for example, name of a student can have first name and the last name.\""
